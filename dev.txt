the <personname>s knew that the <personname>s had a small son too but they had never even seen him
little tyke chortled mr <personname> as he left the house
for a second mr <personname> did not realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again
it must have been a trick of the light
as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day
people in cloaks
he yelled at five different people
he would forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers
<personname> was not such an unusual name
it just gave him a stern look
was this normal cat behavior
trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house
he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife
the newscaster allowed himself a grin
and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather
shooting stars all over britain
instead he said as casually as he could their son he would be about <personname>s age now would not he
his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the <personname>s were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs <personname>
but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street
flocks of owls  shooting stars
it certainly seems so said <personname>
you flatter me said <personname> calmly
professor <personname> shot a sharp look at <personname> and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around
no one knows why or how but they are saying that when he could not kill <personname> <personname>s power somehow broke and that is why he is gone
after all he is done  all the people he is killed  he could not kill a little boy
it was a very odd watch
and i do not suppose you are going to tell me why you are here of all places
i have been watching them all day
you could not find two people who are less like us
and they have got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets
really <personname> you think you can explain all this in a letter
is that where
could i could i say good-bye to him sir
asked <personname>
he could not know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to <personname> the boy who lived the vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since the <personname>s had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all
only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed
up she screeched
<personname> groaned
his aunt snapped through the door
<personname> did not look it but he was very fast
about once a week uncle <personname> looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that <personname> needed a haircut
all right thirty-seven then said <personname> going red in the face
finally he said slowly so i will have thirty  thirty  thirty-nine sweetums said aunt <personname>
bad news <personname> she said
the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she would ever owned
now what
i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt <personname> slowly  and leave him in the car
he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he could not explain how it had grown back so quickly
it was even worth being with <personname> and piers to be spending the day somewhere that was not school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbage-smelling living room
he liked to complain about things people at work <personname> the council <personname> the bank and <personname> were just a few of his favorite subjects
this morning it was motorcycles
<personname> had the best morning he would had in a long time
they ate in the zoo restaurant and when <personname> had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory did not have enough ice cream on top uncle <personname> bought him another one and <personname> was allowed to finish the first
<personname> felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last
it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle <personname>s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it did not look in the mood
he shuffled away
<personname> moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake
he looked back at the snake and winked too
the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and <personname> read on this specimen was bred in the zoo
out of the way you he said punching <personname> in the ribs
as the snake slid swiftly past him <personname> could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come
he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt <personname> had to run and get him a large brandy
he could not remember his parents at all
his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions
<personname> on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school
he went to have a look
no one ever in his whole life had written to him
<personname> went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter
sneered uncle <personname> shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it
it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle <personname> shortly
he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful
it only took <personname> one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room
<personname> was in shock
then he shouted there is another one mr h
surely that meant they would try again
he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot
after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out
he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises
just pack some clothes
they drove
only i got about an undred of these at the front desk
k k k would not it be better just to go home dear
i want to stay somewhere with a television
uncle <personname> was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea
perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine
<personname>s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight
las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant
the <personname>s were cowering against the wall
i mean they are famous
you don know what you are
only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard
warlock supreme mugwump international confed
then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone
i never expected this he said in a low worried voice
he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but it is incredible you do not know his name everyone in our world knows  who
well i don like sayin the name if i can help it
got  them too some were afraid some just wanted a bit of his power because he was gettin himself power all right
dark days <personname>
he was takin over
head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the mystry is why <personname> never tried to get  them on his side before  probably knew they were too close ter <personname> ter want anythin ter do with the dark side
as <personname>s story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh
but what happened to vol sorry i mean <personname>
vanished
people who was on his side came back ter ours
<personname> looked at <personname> with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but <personname> instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake
him
how could he possibly be
had not he set a boa constrictor on him
<personname> looked back at <personname> smiling and saw that <personname> was positively beaming at him
said <personname>
but uncle <personname> was not going to give in without a fight
when he turned his back on them <personname> saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousers
got to get up ter town get all yer books an that
you can kip under that he said
diagon ally <personname> woke early the next morning
<personname> tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat
then he flew off through the open window
<personname> was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them
the boat uncle <personname> had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm
not spposed ter use magic now i have got you
ministry of magic messin things up as usual <personname> muttered turning the page
<personname> said <personname> panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts
wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go
there was a train to london in five minutes time
<personname> unfolded a second piece of paper he had not noticed the night before and read hogwarts s<personname>old owitchcraft and wizardry uniform first-year students will require 1
he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow
they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand
could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them
might this not all be some huge joke that the <personname>s had cooked up
in fact <personname> had the most peculiar feeling that only he and <personname> could see it
for a famous place it was very dark and shabby
the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in
i have seen you before said <personname> as dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his excitement
must get on lots ter buy
he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience
<personname>s head was swimming
three up  two across  he muttered
yeah you will be needin one said <personname> but we got to get yer money first
what is the you-know-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen
moren my jobs worth ter tell you that
<personname> who had expected more marble was surprised
they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches
<personname> tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible
i never know <personname> called to <personname> over the noise of the cart what is the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite
he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall <personname> got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling
and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london
he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away
come on back in this infernal cart and do not talk to me on the way back it is best if i keep me mouth shut said <personname>
might as well get yer uniform said <personname> nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions
listen <personname> would you mind if i slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the leaky cauldron
hogwarts dear
then i am going to drag them off to look at racing brooms
i think i will bully father into getting me one and i will smuggle it in somehow
<personname> was strongly reminded of <personname>
oh said the boy i have heard of him
but they were our kind were not they
i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families
what is up
nothing <personname> lied
anyway what does he know about it some of the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in  them in a long line of muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch
<personname> was one
they bought <personname>s school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all
outside the apothecary <personname> checked <personname>s list again
i will get yer an owl
yes yes
and that is where  mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on <personname>s forehead with a long white finger
he shook his head and then to <personname>s relief spotted <personname>
but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled
that is it
nice and flexible
<personname> took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once
not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple
curious indeed how these things happen
the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as <personname> and <personname> made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty
got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said
i am famous and i cannot even remember what i am famous for
you will learn fast enough
<personname> helped <personname> on to the train that would take him back to the <personname>s then handed him an envelope
the train pulled out of the station
it was lucky that aunt <personname> did not come in to vacuum anymore because <personname> kept bringing back dead mice
uncle <personname> grunted to show he was listening
do not talk rubbish said uncle <personname>
you 11 see
all right we will take you to kings cross
<personname>s mouth went rather dry
cannot you tell i am george
do not stop and do not be scared you will crash into it that is very important
a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people
oy <personname> cmere and help with the twins help <personname>s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment
cannot stay long mother he said
oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom oh please
their mother suddenly became very stern
as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school
<personname> felt a great leap of excitement
he did not know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind
he asked pointing at the seat opposite <personname>
the twins were back
i think moms got a second cousin who is an accountant but we never talk about him
horrible well not all of them
i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet i am the worst in the class
there were four sandwiches inside
he wore half-moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache
underneath the picture was the name <personname>
you can start collecting
bleaaargh see
he looked tearful
sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all
when they shook their heads he wailed i have lost him he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said <personname>
well if you see him  he left
mind you i brought scabbers so i cannot talk
i will show you look  he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand
it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end
she sat down
i have tried a few simple spells just for practice and it is all worked for me
i do not suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin
it is been all over the daily prophet but i do not suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault
course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case <personname>s behind it
<personname> asked
what <personname> looked dumbfounded
my father told me all the <personname>s have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford
you have not been fighting have you
then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and <personname> heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there <personname>
it was so dark on either side of them that <personname> thought there must be thick trees there
nobody spoke much
<personname> and <personname> were followed into their boat by <personname> and <personname>
they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door
you there still got yer toad
the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors
each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards
while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rule breaking will lose house points
at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor
he asked <personname>
new students said the fat friar smiling around at them
about to be sorted i suppose
hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar
<personname> had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place
it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting
it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall did not simply open on to the heavens
i will kill <personname> he was going on about wrestling a troll
<personname> smiled weakly
yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching
if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him
abbott hannah a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down
he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school
granger <personname> <personname> almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head
the hat took a long time to decide with <personname>
<personname> swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin <personname> went to join his friends <personname> and <personname> looking pleased with himself
there were not many people left now
not slytherin eh
<personname> spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron
and now there were only four people left to be sorted
turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was <personname>s turn
well done <personname> excellent said <personname> pompously across <personname> as zabini blaise was made a slytherin
and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down
my brothers told me about you you are nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy  the ghost began stiffly but sandy-haired <personname> interrupted
he seized his left ear and pulled
professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin
harder to shake off was the feeling <personname> had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he did not like <personname> at all
<personname> conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest
a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime
<personname>s legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food
he raised his voice peeves show yourself
oooooooh he said with an evil cackle
she patrolled the corridors alone
the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick
at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached <personname>s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight
you have been warned
send us an answer back with <personname>
<personname> did not dislike <personname> he hated him
<personname> finished calling the names and looked up at the class
<personname> said <personname> suddenly
for your information <personname> asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death
<personname> put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils
said <personname> glancing at <personname>s freckles
the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but <personname> and <personname> pretended to be enjoying them as they told <personname> all about their first lessons
cannot get rid of her <personname> puts her up to it
<personname> told <personname> about <personname>s lesson
or at least they did not until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan
even <personname> would tell anyone who would listen about the time he would almost hit a hang glider on <personname>s old broom
everyone stand by a broomstick
madam hooch was bending over <personname> her face as white as his
<personname> his face tear-streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him
look said <personname> darting forward and snatching something out of the grass
he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from <personname>
said <personname> trying to sneer but looking worried
<personname> only just got out of the way in time <personname> made a sharp about face and held the broom steady
he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist
<personname> his heart sank faster than he would just dived
<personname> follow me now
what would the <personname>s say when he turned up on the doorstep
his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching <personname> and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying <personname>s bag
professor <personname> pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard
<personname> this is oliver wood
the boys a natural
you are joking
i would take you on anytime on my own said <personname>
midnight all right
well meet you in the trophy room that is always unlocked
said <personname>
<personname> ignored him and spoke to <personname>
<personname> had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you you would better dodge it because i cannot remember how to block them
<personname> could not believe anyone could be so interfering
she followed <personname> through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose
all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when you are on the train home tomorrow you are so  but what they were they did not find out
now what am i going to do
mrs norris
breathed <personname> squinting through the dark
it was <personname>
said <personname>
the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them
<personname> suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed <personname> around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor
peeves cackled
do not mess with me peeves now where did they go
all right please
i think well be okay get off <personname> for <personname> had been tugging on the sleeve of <personname>s bathrobe for the last minute
they did not stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor
<personname> suggested
<personname> ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table
it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i do not want everybody knowing you have got a broomstick or they will all want one
you will be in for it this time <personname> first years are not allowed them
<personname> could not resist it
came an angry voice from just behind them
it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he would be learning to play that night
he would never been inside the stadium before
they reminded <personname> of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high
he opened the crate
right said wood
the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score <personname> recited
<personname> swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground
do not worry the <personname>s are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they are like a pair of human bludgers themselves
compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut
that is why seekers get fouled so much
perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but <personname> could hardly believe it when he realized that he would already been at hogwarts two months
<personname>s partner was <personname> which was a relief because <personname> had been trying to catch his eye
<personname> however was to be working with <personname>
swish and flick remember swish and flick
<personname> at the next table was not having much more luck
oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping
it was <personname>
she must have noticed she is got no friends
everyone stared as he reached professor <personname>s chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know
there was an uproar
make way first years coming through excuse me i am a prefect how could a troll get in
maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke
they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them
quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after <personname> s fading footsteps
it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet
the smell coming from it was incredible
the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside
it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have
<personname> pulled the door open and they ran inside
its mean little eyes saw <personname>
the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk
howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with <personname> clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club
a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up
what on earth were you thinking of
you are lucky you were not killed
please professor <personname> they were looking for me
miss granger <personname> had managed to get to her feet at last
i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because i have read all about them
it was about to finish me off when they arrived
miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor <personname>
we should have gotten more than ten points <personname> grumbled
mind you we did save her
there was a very embarrassed pause
on saturday <personname> would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin
<personname> learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert
<personname> <personname> and <personname> moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it would not be allowed
<personname> was checking <personname> and <personname>s charms homework for them
one of his legs was bloody and mangled
how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once
thanks <personname> said <personname> watching <personname> pile ketchup on his sausages
meanwhile in the locker room <personname> and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green
he felt braver
<personname> <personname> and <personname> squeezed together to give <personname> enough space to join them
down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean
lee was still commentating
he is doing something jinxing the broom said <personname>
come on <personname> <personname> muttered desperately
i found out something about him he told <personname>
he tried to get past that three-headed dog on halloween
<personname> dropped the teapot
rubbish said <personname> again
you forget that dog an you forget what it is guardin that is between professor <personname> an <personname> ■ aha said <personname> so there is someone called <personname> involved is there
he was looking over at <personname> as he spoke
so <personname> jealous and angry had gone back to taunting <personname> about having no proper family
professor <personname> had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and <personname> had signed up at once
when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead
hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of <personname>s must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to
how many days you got left until yer holidays
bit keen are not you
it is nothing to you what that dogs guardin
what are you looking for boy
madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him
he <personname> and <personname> had already agreed they would better not ask madam pince where they could find <personname>
what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks
once the holidays had started <personname> and <personname> were having too good a time to think much about <personname>
that is friendly said <personname>
he unwrapped it
<personname> threw the cloak around his shoulders and <personname> gave a yell
there is a note said <personname> suddenly
it is time it was returned to you
<personname> stared at the note
<personname> watched <personname> getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor <personname> on the cheek who to <personname>s amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided
not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it
he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself
suddenly <personname> felt wide-awake
he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything
that had been close very close
he stepped in front of it
he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming
a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving
<personname> was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection
the <personname>s smiled and waved at <personname> and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them
how long he stood there he did not know
have some bacon or something why are not you eating anything
i can only see you
<personname> though was staring transfixed at his image
quick <personname> threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door
come on
want to play chess <personname>
<personname> <personname> and mrs norris are wandering around
i am serious <personname> do not go
and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily
except so back again <personname>
sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than <personname>
strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said <personname> and <personname> was relieved to see that he was smiling
however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth
if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared
now why do not you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed
obviously you have just done so <personname> smiled
another christmas has come and gone and i did not get a single pair
<personname> who came back the day before term started took a different view of things
which was all very well thought <personname> but he had another reason for not wanting <personname> near him while he was playing quidditch
the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but <personname> headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found <personname> and <personname> playing chess
do not talk to me for a moment said <personname> when <personname> sat down next to him i need to concern he caught sight of <personname>s face
he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower
go to professor <personname> <personname> urged <personname>
report him <personname> shook his head
the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor did not it
then he looked up at <personname> and <personname>
said <personname> but <personname> told him to be quiet until she would looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself
at last she found what she was looking for
said <personname> and <personname>
<personname> could have laughed out loud with relief
perhaps that was why <personname> was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that <personname> noticed too
<personname> <personname> and <personname> howled with laughter but <personname> still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him <personname>
he recognized the figures prowling walk
gliding silently over the castle he saw <personname> enter the forest at a run
he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices
we won you won we won shouted <personname> thumping <personname> on the back
let us find an empty room you wait til you hear this
<personname> however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone
ten weeks <personname> snapped
what am i studying for
oh we found out who he is ages ago said <personname> impressively
do you think it had anything to do with the stone
<personname> made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused
oh come on <personname> you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said <personname> in a warm flattering voice
<personname> knew <personname> and <personname> were thinking the same as he was
if <personname> had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it
but he already knew what it was
in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg
ah said <personname> fiddling nervously with his beard that is er  where did you get it <personname>
but what are you going to do with it when it is hatched
<personname> did not like the look on <personname>s face at all
it is nearly out
it sneezed
<personname> had seen the dragon
they looked at the dragon
in romania
it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him
on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat
<personname> had norbert packed and ready in a large crate
<personname>s coming he is got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor <personname> about you <personname> the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that
<personname> took them down to professor <personname>s study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other
he was wrong
she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue
fifty
in one night they would ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup
<personname> did not sleep all night
slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks <personname> we owe you one only <personname> stood by him
well no <personname> admitted
the rest of the team would not speak to <personname> during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker
as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice
<personname> was halfway toward it before he remembered what he would promised himself about not meddling
said <personname>
if we just do a bit of poking around  no said <personname> flatly we have done enough poking around
at eleven of the clock that night they said good-bye to <personname> in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with <personname>
follow me said <personname> lighting a lamp and leading them outside
oh yes  hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me
that is your problem is not it
should have thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble should not you
he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder
that is why yer late is it
you have done yer bit i will take over from here
you have done wrong an now you have got ter pay fer it
silvery stuff
<personname> saw that <personname> looked very worried
who is there
and do you learn much up at the school
yeah said <personname> glancing up too
he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again
so you have not noticed anythin strange
not interested in anythin closern the moon
dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier
nah if you ask me that was what is bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before
<personname> look red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here <personname> shouted
stay on the path i will come back for you they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they could not hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them
at last a great crunching noise announced <personname>s return
look  he murmured holding out his arm to stop <personname>
<personname> had never seen anything so beautiful and sad
then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast
the pain in <personname>s head was so bad he fell to his knees
firenze bane thundered
have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets
do you not understand why it was killed
or have the planets not let you in on that secret
it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around <personname>s heart
<personname> looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort
they went to bed exhausted their throats sore
<personname> did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest
when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment <personname> could not help cheering with the rest
you could look more cheerful <personname> we have got a week before we find out how badly we have done there is no need to worry yet
anyway we have never had any proof <personname> found out how to get past <personname>
he nearly had his leg ripped off once he is not going to try it again in a hurry
<personname> would never tell anyone how to get past <personname>  never  but <personname> suddenly jumped to his feet
why
<personname> i have got to ask you something
he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i look after  so i told him  an i said what i would always really wanted was a dragon  an then  i can remember too well because he kept buyin me drinks
we have got to go to <personname> said <personname>
they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction
why
said <personname> frantically
i have got to talk to professor <personname>
i do not know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it it is too well protected
you want to be more careful said <personname>
no sooner had they reached the door separating <personname> from the rest of the school than professor <personname> turned up again and this time she lost her temper
<personname> shouted
how do you think you would get to the stone without us
better get the cloak <personname> muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning
i will i will fight you <personname> <personname> exploded get away from that hole and do not be an idiot  do not you call me an idiot said <personname>
but leaving <personname> lying motionless on the floor did not feel like a very good omen
should call <personname> i should if something is a-creeping around unseen
peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible
my mistake my mistake i did not see you of course i did not you are invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir
<personname> pushed the door open
<personname> must have left it there
it was not really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop
keep playing <personname> warned <personname> as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor
they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads
i think we will be able to pull the door open said <personname> peering over the dogs back
he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips
we must be miles under the school she said
devils snare devils snare  what did professor sprout say
yeah said <personname> and lucky <personname> does not lose his head in a crisis there is no wood honestly
a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead
he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened
they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys
they nodded
they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone
said <personname> nervously
do we er have to join you to get across
<personname> turned to the other two
finally he said now do not be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess we are not offended said <personname> quickly
i am going to be a knight said <personname>
<personname> whispered
eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head
come on i cannot breathe
at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward
but so will we will not we
of course not said <personname>
but how do we know which to drink
then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them
at last she clapped her hands
got it she said
<personname> looked at the tiny bottle
said <personname> pointing at his scar
here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp
<personname> could not take it in
certainly
all <personname> could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror
he suspected me all along
sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak  you mean he was there in the classroom with you
use the boy  use the boy  quirrell rounded on <personname>
i i have won the house cup for gryffindor
dare he make a break for it
tell me the truth what did you just see
master you are not strong enough i have strength enough  for this
quirrells head looked strangely small without it
it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake
mere shadow and vapor  i have form only when i can share anothers body  but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds
do not be a fool snarled the face
they died begging me for mercy
the evil face was now smiling
i always value bravery
quirrell screamed and tried to throw <personname> off the pain in <personname>s head was building he could not see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and <personname>s yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in <personname>s own head crying <personname> <personname> he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down  down  down  something gold was glinting just above him
then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell he is got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said <personname>
he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop
what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows
i believe your friends misters <personname> and <personname> were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat
but sir the stone  i see you are not to be distracted
very well the stone
nevertheless <personname> while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power
<personname> nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt
<personname> sighed
not a scar no visible sign  to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever
what
and sir there is one more thing  just the one
absolutely not
it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors
<personname> told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and <personname>
said <personname> finally
sending you your fathers cloak and everything
well <personname> exploded if he did i mean to say that is terrible you could have been killed
i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know
i can cannot i
professor <personname> says you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily as though in her opinion professor <personname> did not realize how risky feasts could be
an don say the name <personname> <personname> bellowed and <personname> was so shocked he stopped crying
<personname> gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it
the babble died away
for the best-played game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty points
there are all kinds of courage said <personname> smiling
<personname> had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did
you must come and stay this summer said <personname> both of you i will send you an owl
mrs <personname> smiled down at them
she said
<personname> hung back for a last word with <personname> and <personname>
snarled uncle <personname> a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache
he exchanged dark looks with his wife <personname>
i want more bacon
there is more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt <personname> turning misty eyes on her massive son
the <personname>s were what wizards called muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame
this scar was the only hint of <personname>s very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the <personname>s doorstep eleven years before
at the age of one year old <personname> had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time <personname> whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak
may i take your coats mr and mrs mason
then he rounded on <personname>
exactly said uncle <personname> nastily
and <personname> you 11 say  may i take you through to the dining room mrs mason
said uncle <personname> viciously to <personname>
i will be in my room making no noise and pretending i am not there he said
the masons do not know anything about you and it is going to stay that way
when dinners over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee <personname> and i will bring the subject around to drills
how come you have not got any cards
have not you even got friends at that freak place
<personname> washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper
<personname> knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning
oh really
<personname> has come to tell you sir  it is difficult sir  <personname> wonders where to begin
then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad <personname> bad <personname> do not what are you doing
asked <personname> curiously
they let us <personname> get on with it sir
and the family will never set <personname> free  <personname> will serve the family until he dies sir
i know lots of people do not like it
<personname> must stay where he is safe
but why are you warning me
slowly <personname> shook his head
a sudden silence fell downstairs
i expect they have just been wait a minute said <personname> frowning
<personname> has them here sir said the elf
aunt <personname> was just passing around a box of after dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs masons head and swooped out again
dear mr <personname> we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine
stop it <personname> muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head
and someone was goggling through the bars at him a freckle-faced red-haired long-nosed someone
<personname> ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground
panting <personname> hoisted them up into the car
watch out for the bottom stair it creaks <personname> whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing
inch by inch the trunk slid through the window
a bit more panted <personname> who was pulling from inside the car
but as <personname> climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle <personname>s voice
<personname> <personname> and george seized <personname>s arms and pulled as hard as they could
he is getting away he is getting away but the <personname>s gave a gigantic tug and <personname>s leg slid out of uncle <personname>s grasp <personname> was in the car he would slammed the door shut put your foot down <personname> yelled <personname> and the car shot suddenly toward the moon
see you next summer <personname> yelled
she has not had a chance to stretch her wings for ages
very fishy said <personname> finally
can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you
<personname> <personname> explained
<personname> had heard these rumors about <personname>s family before and they did not surprise him at all
<personname> made <personname> <personname> look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy
the owl mum and dad bought <personname> when he was made prefect said <personname> from the front
i mean there is only so many times you can polish a prefect badge
er no said <personname> he had to work tonight
what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway
we will be there in ten minutes
catchpole
it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which <personname> reminded himself it probably was
four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof
ah said <personname>
he had never been in a wizard house before
the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all
you keep your mouth closed while you are eating mrs <personname> snapped
they were starving him mum said george
and you said mrs <personname> but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting <personname> bread and buttering it for him
yeah she will be wanting your autograph <personname> <personname> said with a grin but he caught his mothers eye and bent his face over his plate without another word
george groaned
as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who <personname> supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all
oh he is marvelous she said
<personname> held it at arms length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down
said mr <personname> eagerly
did it go all right
second-year students will require the standard book of spells grade 2 by miranda goshawk break with a banshee by gilderoy lockhart gadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhart holidays with hags by gilderoy lockhart travels with trolls by gilderoy lockhart voyages with vampires by gilderoy lockhart wanderings with werewolves by gilderoy lockhart year with the yeti by gilderoy lockhart <personname> who had finished his own list peered over at <personname>s
you have been told to get all lockharts books too he said
morning all said <personname> briskly
finally he is got <personname>s answer
we are on vacation and we are going to london next wednesday to buy my new books
it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they did not fly too high
five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders
ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing <personname>s puzzled look
if we are not careful we will have another head boy in the family
five sets of lockhart books and <personname> needs robes and a wand and everything
sorry <personname> i forgot
i went on the underground  really
<personname> would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney do not worry about that  well  all right  you go after <personname> said mrs <personname>
seconds later a bell clanged and <personname> stepped into the shop
the ministry would not presume to trouble you sir surely
trying to stay calm he wondered what to do
<personname> backed away
i am just  <personname> what dyou think yer doing down there
yer a mess said <personname> gruffly brushing soot off <personname> so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary
they are ruinin the school cabbages
lousy muggles growled <personname>
we have never been allowed in said <personname> enviously
oh <personname> oh my dear you could have been anywhere  gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot <personname> had not managed to beat away
did <personname> buy anything
<personname> muttered vaguely about needing a new quill
well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs <personname> setting off with <personname>
that sounds fascinating
he wants to be minister of magic  <personname> told <personname> and <personname> in an undertone as they left <personname> to it
as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in
the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today 1230 p
she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair
this is for the daily prophet big deal said <personname> rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it
the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized <personname>s arm and pulled him to the front
together you and i are worth the front page
mr <personname> flushed darker than either <personname> or <personname>
here girl take your book it is the best your father can give you  pulling himself out of <personname>s grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop
<personname> took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder
it was difficult not to feel jealous of <personname> when he thought of the <personname>s and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive
he barely had time to wonder when he would see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks
<personname> had caught the hogwarts express the previous year
we are going to miss the train <personname> whispered
people were still watching them mainly because of <personname>s continuing screeches
then there was a popping noise and the car <personname> and <personname> reappeared
i can see it <personname> yelled
<personname> pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest
<personname> found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake
are you okay
look at my wand  it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters
the tree they had hit was attacking them
aaargh said <personname> as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving run for it <personname> shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into <personname>s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch
well done car  the car however had reached the end of its tether
it was not at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured
overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars
there is an empty chair at the staff table
said <personname> enthusiastically
in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing
so he said softly the train is not good enough for the famous <personname> and his faithful sidekick <personname>
<personname> gulped
silence snapped <personname> again
<personname> and <personname> stared at each other white-faced
professor <personname> said coldly to <personname>
he knew <personname> would see through this at once but <personname> asked no questions about the car
he turned to professor <personname>
not much said <personname> hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve
professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted  the sorting ceremony is over said professor <personname>
why could not we get through the barrier
arms reached through the portrait hole to pull <personname> and <personname> inside leaving <personname> to scramble in after them
brilliant yelled lee jordan
<personname> was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off
<personname> could not help it
things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall
well i do not know what you expected <personname> but you do not tell me i deserved it snapped <personname>
after all mr and mrs <personname> had done for him over the summer  but he had no time to dwell on this professor <personname> was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules
gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming
greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self
they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants
professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door
<personname> i have been wanting a word you do not mind if he is a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout
could have kicked myself
stood out a mile
gave you a taste for publicity did not i
i know i know it is not quite as good as winning witch weeklys most-charming-smile award five times in a row as i have but it is a start <personname> it is a start he gave <personname> a hearty wink and strode off
<personname> stood stunned for a few seconds then remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid inside
when <personname> had taken his place between <personname> and <personname> she said we will be repotting mandrakes today
there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that was not pink and fluffy
four to a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in the sacks over there and be careful of the venomous tentacula it is teething
she gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder
said justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost
the mandrakes did not like coming out of the earth but did not seem to want to go back into it either
everything <personname> had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer
unable to see what he was doing <personname> accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one
what have we got this afternoon
he was clutching what looked like an ordinary muggle camera and the moment <personname> looked at him he went bright red
dyou think would it be all right if can i have a picture
everyone is told me
i never knew all the odd stuff i could do was magic till i got the letter from hogwarts
my dads a milkman he could not believe it either
<personname>s giving out signed photos no i am not said <personname> angrily his fists clenching
said <personname> who did not need to shout anymore half the courtyard was listening in
be careful <personname> sneered <personname>
when the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell
<personname> raised a trembling hand
quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor and so to business  he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto it
now be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room
as the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the cover
freshly caught cornish pixies
said <personname> who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out
i heard someone saying your name on the stairs <personname> look what i have got here i have had it developed i wanted to show you  <personname> looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishing under his nose
were not you
is that your own broom
wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows and crosses in different-colored inks
now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all
okay let us go and put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms
they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium
he is in gryffindor said <personname> quickly
<personname> <personname> and george followed
and from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face
all seven of them held out their broomsticks
he was looking at <personname> taking in his slytherin quidditch robes
<personname> was on all fours banging the ground with his fist
but you can cure him cannot you
get out of the way colin said <personname> angrily
bin wonderin when you would come ter see me come in come in thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again  <personname> and <personname> supported <personname> over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin which had an enormous bed in one corner a fire crackling merrily in the other
i do not think there is anything to do except wait for it to stop said <personname> anxiously watching <personname> bend over the basin
if one word of it was true i will eat my kettle
<personname> however said in a voice somewhat higher than usual i think you are being a bit unfair
dirty blood see
yer more famous than him without tryin
bet he did not like that said <personname> sitting up and rubbing his chin
no thanks said <personname> weakly
well you have done a good job on them
watch it <personname> roared pulling <personname> away from his precious pumpkins
professor <personname> was walking toward them looking stern
you will both do your detentions this evening
said <personname> desperately
lockhart beamed down at him
another large pile lay on his desk
you can address the envelopes lockhart told <personname> as though this was a huge treat
come  come to me
half an hour later <personname> arrived nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room
it is not as though i really wanted to join
nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so what is bothering you
you would better get out of here <personname> said nick quickly
<personname> braced himself for a tidal wave of fury
to escape from <personname> s office without punishment was probably some kind of school record
nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom
friends will be coming from all over the country
i bet there are not many living people who can say they have been to one of those it will be fascinating why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died
rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful
you said you would go to the deathday party
the temperature dropped with every step they took
the dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised black-draped platform
careful not to walk through anyone said <personname> nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor
oh no said <personname> stopping abruptly
yes
they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified
can you taste it if you walk through it
almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away
i feel sick said <personname>
he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face
she said sulkily
you are making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small see-through eyes
fat <personname> ugly <personname> miserable moaning moping <personname> you have forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear
peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimplyl oh dear said <personname> sadly
and then <personname> heard it
<personname> was sure it was moving away moving upward
a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward
it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall
<personname> what was that all about
i could not hear anything
then someone shouted through the quiet
you you have murdered my cat you have killed her i will kill you i will  <personname>
lockhart stepped forward eagerly
lockharts comments were punctuated by <personname> s dry racking sobs
said <personname> a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face
i did not think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties
you may go <personname> said to <personname> <personname> and <personname>
when they were a floor up from lockharts office they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them
a clock chimed somewhere
they will catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time
<personname> found <personname> at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework
said <personname> furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll
i wish i had not left my copy at home but i could not fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books
you have had ten days to finish it  i only need another two inches come on  the bell rang
he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before
professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of 1289 looked amazed
professor binns blinked
well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose
the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin
but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets
the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic
the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said
that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice
i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes
nonsense oflaherty said professor binns in an aggravated tone
but i never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff
as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevey went past
this is funny
you have used spiders in potions loads of times
it is not funny said <personname> fiercely
you would not like them either if you would been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and  he broke off shuddering
they are not girls
said <personname>
all right said <personname> coldly
no one would know it was us
the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet
just for background reading
i was a seeker too
<personname> was crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and she them
<personname> opened moste potente potions carefully and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages
<personname> shut the book with a snap
the team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen to woods usual pre match pep talk
three  two  one  with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky
let us ask for an inquiry  if we stop now we will have to forfeit the match said <personname>
she asked wood
i will keep it like this thanks
great capture <personname> really spectacular your best yet i would say  through the thicket of legs around him <personname> spotted <personname> and <personname> wrestling the rogue bludger into a box
what he saw nearly made him pass out again
you should have come straight to me she raged holding up the sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been a working arm
we won though said <personname> a grin breaking across his face
the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment
they had brought cakes sweets and bottles of pumpkin juice they gathered around <personname>s bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest he is got thirty three bones to regrow out out and <personname> was left alone with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm
for a second he thought that was what had woken him
it was you he said slowly
<personname> was so shocked when he heard <personname> was back at hogwarts he let his masters dinner burn such a flogging <personname> never had sir
but mostly sir life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over <personname>
and now at hogwarts terrible things are to happen are perhaps happening already and <personname> cannot let <personname> stay here now that history is to repeat itself now that the chamber of secrets is open once more  <personname> froze horrors truck then grabbed <personname>s water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head toppling out of sight
who is opened it
there was a bunch of grapes next to him said professor <personname>
excellent flying yesterday really excellent
dyou know what i think
he was in such a foul temper after the quidditch match he took it out on colin
they were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues
<personname> smiled feebly
<personname> ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of <personname>s filibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with his wand
<personname> arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression
and bow <personname> and <personname> barely inclined their heads not taking their eyes off each other
<personname> hung back with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch <personname> while he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breath <personname> pointed his wand at <personname>s knees choked tarantallegral and the next second <personname>s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep
we will be sending what is left of finch-fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox
just do what i did <personname> what drop my wand
there were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away clearing the floor
i will get rid of it
he looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin looking relieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry and scared
then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes
come on said <personname>s voice in his ear
oh no they cannot said <personname>
it matters said <personname> speaking at last in a hushed voice because being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin was famous for
through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered  could he be a descendant of salazar slytherin
he did not know anything about his fathers family after all
go and find justin if it is so important to you
that first year creevey was annoying <personname> at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud
he cannot be all bad can he
they all looked fearfully at ernie
said ernie in a quavering voice
all righ <personname>
it is nothing he said
but he could not just leave them lying here
for several long minutes there was a scene of such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in nearly headless nick
as he and professor <personname> stepped onto it <personname> heard the wall thud closed behind them
it was a large and beautiful circular room full of funny little noises
er yes <personname> muttered
phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes
what could possibly do that to a ghost
<personname>s in a hurry
yeah he is off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant said george chortling
it is because he is bursting to say it is really him said <personname> knowingly
we will be getting the truth out of him any day now
merry christmas to you too said <personname> throwing him his present
they lurked in the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for <personname> and <personname> who had remained alone at the slytherin table shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle
<personname> whispered ecstatically as <personname> gleefully pointed out the cakes to <personname> and grabbed them
grinning stupidly they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths
for a moment both of them chewed greedily looks of triumph on their faces
then without the smallest change of expression they both keeled over backward onto the floor
once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops <personname> yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered <personname> s forehead and <personname> pulled out several of <personname> s hairs
they also stole their shoes because their own were far too small for <personname> and <personname>-size feet
then still stunned at what they had just done they sprinted up to <personname>s bathroom
<personname> showed her <personname>s hair
then her hand trembling she shook millicent bulstrodes hair out of its bottle into the first glass
bet it tastes disgusting
careful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion <personname> slipped into the middle stall
<personname> scratched his ear
i only hope we can find someone to follow  <personname> who had been gazing at <personname> said you do not know how bizarre it is to see <personname> thinking
he banged on <personname>s door
<personname> glanced witheringly at <personname>
and what are you doing down here <personname>
he sneered
oh yeah pure-blood said <personname> not listening and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open
ha ha said <personname> bleakly
what is up with you <personname>
a decent headmaster would never ve let slime like that creevey in
so i bet it is a matter of time before one of thems killed this time
you know the ministry of magic raided our manor last week
<personname> and <personname> looked at each other
it is awful  they heard the lock slide back and <personname> emerged sobbing her robes pulled up over her head
m-millicent bulstrode m-must have a cat and the p-potion is not supposed to be used for animal transformations uh-oh said <personname>
you will be teased something dreadful said <personname> happily
madam pomfrey never asks too many questions
<personname> looked up at <personname> disgusted
but <personname> was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine
said <personname>
do not ask me <personname> shouted emerging with a wave of yet more water which splashed onto the already sopping floor
come off it how could it be dangerous
<personname> saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old
they were completely blank
<personname> left the hospital wing de-whiskered tail less and fur-free at the beginning of february
there is nothing written in his diary
she rubbed hard on january first
i am telling you there is nothing to find in there said <personname>
<personname>s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet
from where he sat <personname> could see a muscle going in professor <personname>s cheek
all day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon as the gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfs caught up with <personname>
losing his head <personname> tried to make a run for it but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor
he pulled out his wand and shouted  expelliarmusv and just as <personname> had disarmed lockhart so <personname> found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air
i will have to report this you know but <personname> did not care he was one-up on <personname> and that was worth five points from gryffindor any day
i mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things
his heart was hammering
i am sorry he said shakily
there was a knock on the office door
but <personname> was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given <personname>
dippet sank back looking faintly disappointed
all he could see was the figure of <personname> at the door staring through the crack waiting like a statue
i am going to have to turn you in <personname>
he wouldn he never stand aside said <personname> drawing out his wand
<personname> half wished he had not found out how to work <personname>s diary
again and again <personname> and <personname> made him recount what he would seen until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long circular conversations that followed
<personname> asked dully
otherwise <personname> would not have got his award
i just want to give up potions said <personname>
confused and worried he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes
<personname> took nobodys advice but signed up for everything
not that he did not get any guidance <personname> was eager to share his experience
my brother <personname> was always more of an outdoor type so he went for care of magical creatures
but the only thing <personname> felt he was really good at was quidditch
is there anything missing
<personname> looked aghast at the news
as quickly as you can please then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned <personname> over to her
<personname> i think you would better come with me
i need to address the students in any case
the gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professor <personname> in silence
and if the culprit was not caught soon he was looking at a lifetime back with the <personname>s
<personname> now knew exactly how he had felt
the journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors was not enjoyable
it was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open
nothing nothing  <personname> muttered
he poured them both large mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door
the stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit a scarlet tie a long black cloak and pointed purple boots
very bad business
look <personname> said <personname> uncomfortably
i am under a lot of pressure
for a short stretch only said <personname> not meeting <personname> s eyes
if someone else is caught you will be let out with a full apology  not azkaban
<personname> answered it
i am afraid we feel you are losing your touch
we shall all miss your er highly individual way of running things <personname> and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any ah killins
<personname> constantly repeated <personname>s final words to himself
but what good were these words
<personname> will not last long she is only filling in
professor <personname> has only been suspended by the governors
the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and <personname>
several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting
and <personname> looked even unhappier about that
<personname> and <personname> kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when <personname> george and <personname> finally went to bed
he could vividly remember <personname> advising him not to leave the forest path last time he would been in here
there is something moving over there <personname> breathed
hear me
there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence
<personname> did not even have time to turn around
struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw <personname>s legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees
craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on
there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white
he was blind
click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow
<personname> has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly
and you  you did not come from the chamber of secrets
i come from a distant land
the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom
well do i remember how i pleaded with <personname> to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school
said <personname> urgently
well just go then <personname> called desperately to <personname> hearing leaves rustling behind him
are you okay
fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when <personname> opened the door he shot off through the trees to <personname>s house tail between his legs
follow the spiders said <personname> weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve
that <personname> never opened the chamber of secrets said <personname> throwing the cloak over <personname> and prodding him in the arm to make him walk
there was nobody else to ask
what if she is still there
<personname> rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight
you do not think not <personname>
escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls bathroom the girls bathroom moreover right next to the scene of the first attack was going to be almost impossible
we are still getting exams
there was a loud bang behind <personname> as <personname> <personname>s wand slipped vanishing one of the legs on his desk
what is it
<personname>ly i am astounded professor <personname> thinks all these security measures are necessary
but just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme <personname> <personname> what are you doing
of course she said and <personname> amazed saw a tear glistening in her beady eye
its methods of killing are most wondrous for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs the basilisk has a murderous stare and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death
i have been hearing that voice inside the walls
what if it is a bathroom
it was a large paneled room full of dark wooden chairs
<personname> and <personname> paced around it too excited to sit down
all teachers return to the staffroom
no said <personname> glancing around
let us hear what it is all about
professor flitwick burst into tears
we shall have to send all the students home tomorrow said professor <personname>
but it was lockhart and he was beaming
that is right gilderoy chipped in professor sprout
<personname> was not there
he had gone to send an owl to mr and mrs <personname> then shut himself up in his dormitory
no afternoon ever lasted as long as that one nor had gryffindor tower ever been so crowded yet so quiet
my dear boy said lockhart straightening up and frowning at <personname>
do use your common sense
<personname> was pleased to see that he was shaking
where exactly did you see the eyes
said <personname>
english he said
boys he said his voice feeble
lockhart slid his legs into the pipe
<personname> lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones
lockhart got to his feet then he dived at <personname> knocking him to the ground
wait there he called to <personname>
so you can can get back through
and <personname>  see you in a bit said <personname> trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice
he wanted the tunnel to end yet dreaded what he would find when it did
and then at last as he crept around yet another bend he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved their eyes set with great glinting emeralds
he could guess what he had to do
<personname> said uncertainly
did you see
<personname> was still watching him twirling <personname>s wand between his long fingers
he continued to stare at <personname> twirling the wand idly
what dyou mean i will not be
there was something very funny going on here
so <personname> poured out her soul to me and her soul happened to be exactly what i wanted
i grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears her darkest secrets
yes said <personname> calmly
dear <personname> he recited watching <personname>s horrified face 7 think i am losing my memory
dear <personname> i cannot remember what i did on the night of halloween but a cat was attacked and i have got paint all down my front
i think i am the one attacking everyone <personname> <personname>s fists were clenched the nails digging deep into his palms
you found it and i could not have been more delighted
i thought you made a mistake but  <personname> laughed his high laugh again
no ones died this time not even the cat
and <personname> had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak parseltongue
she put too much into the diary into me
i have many questions for you <personname>
you are not he said his quiet voice full of hatred
it was eerie spine-tingling unearthly it lifted the hair on <personname>s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size
a second later the bird was flying straight at <personname>
the bird stopped singing
fawkes
<personname> did not answer
but i know why you could not kill me
that is where all your power got you
yes that is a powerful counter-charm
speak to me slytherin  greatest of the hogwarts four
and something was stirring inside the statues mouth
something was slithering up from its depths
something huge hit the stone floor of the chamber
<personname> seized it
it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisks tail swung over him again
the basilisks head was falling its body coiling around hitting pillars as it twisted to face him
alone in the chamber of secrets forsaken by his friends defeated at last by the dark <personname> he so unwisely challenged
you will be back with your dear mudblood mother soon <personname>
instead of going black the chamber seemed to be coming back into focus
ink spurted out of the diary in torrents streaming over <personname>s hands flooding the floor
slowly he gathered together his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisks mouth
after a few minutes progress up the dark tunnel a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached <personname>s ears
back there said <personname> still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe
<personname> looked uncertainly at him
<personname> goggled at them
fawkes was leading the way glowing gold along the corridor
said mr <personname> in a stunned voice
en-enchant <personname>
i taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts
what is our <personname> got to do with with him
what have i always told you
i found it inside one of the books mum got me
there will be no punishment
<personname> opened his mouth in horror
but one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure <personname> added
when <personname> addressed him lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to
nothing but that could have called fawkes to you
he stroked the phoenix which had fluttered down onto his knee
you can speak parseltongue <personname> said <personname> calmly because <personname> who is the last remaining descendant of salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue
listen to me <personname>
dear me we do seem to run through them do not we
he had just reached for the handle however when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall
and imagine <personname> went on what might have happened then
he nodded at <personname> and <personname> backed into a corner now twisting his ears in punishment
do not you want to know how <personname> got hold of that diary mr <personname>
because you gave it to her said <personname>
he saw mr <personname>s white hands clench and unclench
on the other hand i would advise you <personname> not to go giving out any more of <personname>s old school things
then he ran down the dark corridor
spat mr <personname>
<personname> freed <personname> said the elf shrilly gazing up at <personname> moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes
<personname> is greater by far than <personname> knew he sobbed
farewell <personname> and with a final loud crack <personname> disappeared
<personname> what did you see <personname> doing that he did not want you to tell anyone
oh that said <personname> giggling
he was so upset when she was you know attacked
your aunt and uncle will be proud though will not they
said <personname> as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier
are you crazy
for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night
<personname> who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard <personname>s voice answer
<personname> had been absent for two nights now
he scanned the starry sky for a sign of <personname> perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise
gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before <personname> realized what he was seeing
through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious
<personname> recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the <personname> family
<personname> could not think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the <personname>s who were very nice and extremely poor
mum would not let <personname> come in the last one
we will be back about a week before term starts and we will be going up to london to get my wand and our new books
<personname> glanced back at the photograph
i really hope you can
one of <personname>s most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom
<personname> froze
<personname> had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three-headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin
far from wishing <personname> a happy birthday none of the <personname>s made any sign that they had noticed <personname> enter the room but <personname> was far too used to this to care
look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair he shot a nasty look sideways at <personname> whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle <personname>
<personname>tic could be coming up the street right now aunt <personname> who was bony and horse-faced whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window
margell be here for a week uncle <personname> snarled and while we are on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at <personname> we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her
secondly said uncle <personname> acting as though he had not heard <personname>s reply as marge does not know anything about your abnormality i do not want any any funny stuff while she is here
i will if she does said <personname> through gritted teeth
<personname> sat there white-faced and furious staring at uncle <personname> hardly able to believe it
so
snapped uncle <personname> taking his car keys from a hook next to the door
sneered uncle <personname>
well said <personname> choosing his words carefully it will be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st
knocking the stuffing out of me will not make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly
right he snapped finally
<personname> did not return to the kitchen
aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be
where is my dudders
tea marge
who is looking after the other dogs marge
he pines if he is away from me
still here are you
do not you smirk at me boomed aunt marge
she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again <personname>
it is one of the basic rules of breeding she said
you see it all the time with dogs
if there is something wrong with the bitch there will be something wrong with the pup  at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand
can i tempt you marge
you get that with dogs
underbred
<personname> was shaking all over
more brandy yelled uncle <personname> who had gone very white
go to bed go on  no <personname> hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on <personname>s
they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury
he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle <personname>
i am going <personname> said
he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go
he did not have any muggle money either
gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus
what were you doing down there
he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence
said stan
nothing said <personname> quickly flattening his hair over his scar
you ave this one stan whispered shoving <personname>s trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel
there was another tremendous bang and the next moment <personname> found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus
them said stan contemptuously
well be in abergavenny in a minute
well really i had to do not you know said an irritable <personname>
he murdered thirteen people
they ad a job coverin it up din they ern
what was it they said ad appened ern
ear about that arry <personname>
<personname> would not soon forget the look of terror on <personname> s face when he had been told where he was going and <personname> was one of the bravest people <personname> knew
they all looked very pleased to go
it was <personname> the wizened toothless landlord
perhaps a pot of tea said <personname> who still had not let go of <personname>
said stan beaming at <personname> while ernies owlish face peered interestedly over stans shoulder
<personname> who could not believe his ears opened his mouth to speak could not think of anything to say and closed it again
the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry oh my dear boy we are not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried <personname> waving his crumpet impatiently
laughed <personname>
do not want to lose you again do we
<personname> shuddered slightly
<personname> was looking uncomfortable
in fact i think it is best if you do not  yes  well i will be off
enjoy your stay <personname>
<personname> did not have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave <personname> free sundaes every half an hour
most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divination
thank heavens for that
stop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart
you will start seeing death omens everywhere
it is enough to frighten anyone to death
but <personname> continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes
somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open and sun was pouring inside
he looked at <personname>
anyway you can ask dad yourself this evening
so have you got all your new books and stuff
errols a family owl
all i have got is scabbers
it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing
<personname> lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look
how much ouch <personname> buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itself spitting madly at scabbers
<personname> stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his head
that was a matter of opinion thought <personname>
the cats ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall
<personname>s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard
at that moment mrs <personname> entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins <personname> and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy <personname> and the <personname>s youngest child and only girl <personname>
mum said <personname> as though he would only just spotted her and seizing her hand too
we tried to shut him in a pyramid he told <personname>
how are we getting to kings cross tomorrow dad
said <personname> curiously
<personname> scowled at <personname>
he is thirteen years old and  <personname> the truth would terrify him said mrs <personname> shrilly
but no ones really sure that <personname>s after <personname>  there was a thud on wood and <personname> was sure mr <personname> had banged his fist on the table
if you ask me he thinks murdering <personname> will bring <personname> back to power
<personname> lost everything the night <personname> stopped <personname> and he is had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that
well <personname> you must do what you think is right
the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier
the badge now read bigheacl boy
this explained everything
and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the <personname>s could look after <personname> until he was on the train
nobody would want <personname> to leave the safety of the castle until <personname> was caught in fact <personname> suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed
later <personname> muttered as <personname> stormed in
you will not snapped <personname>
once the remaining <personname>s and <personname> had joined them <personname> and <personname> led the way to the end of the train past packed compartments to a carriage that looked quite empty
mr <personname> flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it
professor <personname> whispered <personname> at once
when he would finished <personname> looked thunderstruck and <personname> had her hands over her mouth
she finally lowered them to say <personname> escaped to come after you
it is coming from your trunk <personname> said <personname> standing up and reaching into the luggage rack
it was spinning very fast in the palm of <personname>s hand and glowing brilliantly
<personname> and george told me
at one of the clock the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door
dyou think we should wake him up
she said
we cannot be there yet said <personname> checking her watch
i am going to go and ask the driver what is going on came <personname>s voice
who is that
there was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment
he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder  and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrified pleading screams
the hooded creature had vanished
here he said to <personname> handing him a particularly large piece
i need to speak to the driver excuse me  he strolled past <personname> and disappeared into the corridor
it was horrible said <personname> in a higher voice than usual
said <personname> awkwardly
no said <personname> looking anxiously at <personname> again
<personname> yelled over the heads of the crowd
with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at <personname> and <personname> and led them up the steps into the castle
she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor <personname> sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train <personname>
he will not be the last one who collapses
he gave it to all of us
welcome said <personname> the candlelight shimmering on his beard
i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you
<personname> knew that expression only too well it was the look <personname> wore every time he set eyes on <personname>
we should have known <personname> roared pounding the table
that little git he said calmly
you did not pass out though did you
forget it <personname> said george bracingly
<personname> snapped
he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table still swinging the polecat
<personname> checked his course schedule
the shouts of laughter followed <personname> into the entrance hall
i think it is this way said <personname> peering down the empty passage to the right
get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he could not get it out again
it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle
nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement
is your grandmother well
i would not be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings
swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read
you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future
<personname> tried to pull himself together
let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to <personname> sweeping over and snatching <personname>s cup from him
everyone went quiet to watch
professor trelawney stared at her
she lowered her huge eyes to <personname>s cup again and continued to turn it
dear dear this is not a happy cup
i thought that was a bowler hat said <personname> sheepishly
the skull  danger in your path my dear
the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that <personname> had not understood
yes  please pack away your things
if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues  professor <personname> broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white
<personname> laughed
it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor trelawneys classroom
<personname> if <personname>s seen a grim that is that is bad he said
you do not know what you are talking about said <personname> starting to get angry
you did not seem quite so confident when you were telling <personname> it was a sheep said <personname> coolly
however <personname> strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock
said the cold drawling voice of <personname>
you have got ter stroke  them said <personname> as though this was the most obvious thing in the world
oh how silly we have all been <personname> sneered
we should have stroked them why did not we guess i i thought they were funny <personname> said uncertainly to <personname>
that oaf teaching classes my fatherll have a fit when i tell him  shut up <personname> <personname> repeated
everyone drew back slightly as <personname> reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence
said <personname> with a pleading look
there was an intake of breath from behind him and both <personname> and parvati whispered oooh no <personname> remember your tea leaves <personname> ignored them
he gave a short bow and then looked up
right back away now <personname> easy does it  but then to <personname>s enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow
good work <personname> roared <personname> as everyone except <personname> <personname> and <personname> cheered
i am dying look at me it is killed me yer not dyin said <personname> who had gone very white
they would not fire him would they
a large group including <personname> and <personname> was huddled together deep in conversation
<personname> was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in <personname>s lap
you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them
thas better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all
listen it was good of you ter come an see me i really  <personname> stopped dead staring at <personname> as though he would only just realized he was there
he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in <personname>s opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle
but <personname> saw him wink at <personname> and <personname> when pansy had looked away
<personname> set up his cauldron right next to <personname> and <personname> so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table
<personname> smirked across the table
did not i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice
help me he moaned to <personname>
the end of the lesson in sight <personname> strode over to <personname> who was cowering by his cauldron
if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole
five points from gryffindor said <personname> which wiped the smiles from every face
good afternoon he said
a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books
right then said professor <personname> when everyone was ready
loony loopy <personname> loony loopy <personname>  rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers
however peeves paid no attention to professor <personname>s words except to blow a loud wet raspberry
professor <personname> was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in
he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him
now then said professor <personname> beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes
nothing to worry about said professor <personname> calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm
wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks i have even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock
not remotely frightening
no no you misunderstand me said professor <personname> now smiling
and a long dress  green normally  and sometimes a fox-fur scarf
yes said <personname> uncertainly plainly wondering what was coming next
the room went quiet
<personname> was muttering to himself take its legs off
everyone ready
but he did not want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves
i will call the next person forward
one two three now a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor <personname>s wand and hit the doorknob
<personname> rounded on her
a bandage unraveled at the mummys feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off
<personname> darted past parvati
then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of <personname> who said riddikulusv almost lazily
crack  forward <personname> and finish him off said <personname> as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach
excellent cried professor <personname> as the class broke into applause
talking excitedly the class left the staffroom
he could not like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class
<personname> seemed to have lost his confidence
we have got two unbeatable beaters
the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years
<personname> i am sure you will be able to go next time she said
<personname>s supposed to stay in school  he cannot be the only third year left behind said <personname>
crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw
all cats chase rats <personname> there is something funny about that animal said <personname> who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket
<personname> was still in a bad mood with <personname> next day
they had transfiguration next
i should have known said <personname> tragically
oh said <personname>
then was binky an old rabbit
h he was only a baby parvati tightened her arm around <personname>s shoulders
professor <personname> opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky <personname> and <personname> were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of <personname> and did not talk to each other for the whole class
she seemed to think it was safer
you heard what i said
no form no visiting the village
nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind
they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you <personname> it is not all it is cracked up to be he said seriously
all right the sweetshops rather good and zonkos joke shops frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking shacks always worth a visit but really <personname> apart from that you are not missing anything
<personname> wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he did not feel like working
<personname> snarled suspiciously
why do not you come in
you are not worried are you
i imagined that people would panic
you should drink that directly <personname>
<personname> began
disgusting he said
right said <personname> putting down his empty teacup
where did you go
by the sound of it everywhere
said <personname> looking anxious
no said <personname>
<personname> made me a cup of tea in his office
we would better go down you know the feastll be starting in five minutes
they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing <personname>
ashamed your headship sir
nasty temper he is got that <personname>
the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor <personname> told them as professors <personname> and flitwick closed all doors into the hall
send word with one of the ghosts
it is very lucky he picked tonight you know said <personname> as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk
there is no point moving them all now
hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor
all searched  very well <personname>
it seems almost impossible that <personname> could have entered the school without inside help
did not they want to help sir
the fat ladys ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony
sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer
he waited holding his breath
we are playing hufflepuff instead
and we have been practicing all those moves assuming we are playing slytherin and instead it is hufflepuff and their styles quite different
he is only silent because he is too thick to string two words together said <personname> impatiently
we are taking hufflepuff very seriously
<personname> had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow
he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said <personname> with a twisted smile
<personname> walked slowly to his seat and sat down
<personname> looked more menacing than ever
<personname> is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows
werewolves said <personname>
but sir said <personname> seemingly unable to restrain herself we are not supposed to do werewolves yet we are due to start hinkypunks  miss granger said <personname> in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you
he glanced around again
everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except <personname> whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air
without magid he was breathing deeply his fists clenched
he could have finished him off for us <personname> woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was still dark
cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest
the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room
he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him
i called for time-out wood roared at his team
<personname> was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them with a jolt of panic <personname> threw himself flat to the broom-handle and zoomed toward the snitch
her eyes were extremely bloodshot
what happened
<personname> got the snitch said george
but they won fair and square  even wood admits it
we heard him  then he magicked you onto a stretcher said <personname>
and
he said dreading the answer
and then there were the dementors
we do not know anything about werewolves   two rolls of parchment did you tell professor <personname> we have not covered them yet
<personname> sighed
people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk
did you hear about the dementors too
said <personname> with difficulty
he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself
it has nothing to do with weakness said professor <personname> sharply as though he had read <personname>s mind
get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you
if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself  soul less and evil
said <personname> bitterly
inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air
the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays
to everyone is delight except <personname>s there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term
how come you are not going to hogsmeade
he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue
<personname> pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks
well  when we were in our first year <personname> young carefree and innocent  <personname> snorted
we do not reckon <personname> ever found out how to work it
and you know how to work it
a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor <personname> was pacing his study the caretakers cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room
moony wormtail padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map
never trust anything that can think for itself if you cannot see where it keeps its brain
<personname> watched carefully
<personname> hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of him
after what felt like an hour the passage began to rise
<personname> stood there massaging the top of his head listening
<personname> sneaked up behind them
how about these
wow said <personname> looking very impressed you have learned to apparate  course i have not said <personname>
this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of <personname>
anyway <personname> the honeydukes owners would hear a break-in would not they
the door of the three broomsticks had opened again
next he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heels and heard a womans voice
come and join us
why had not it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too
i am sure of it said <personname> shortly
it is very bad for business minister
worse than murdering all those poor people you mean
what could possibly be worse
then they named him godfather to <personname>
how does that work
professor flitwick cleared his throat
and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed  <personname> betrayed them
i comforted the murderin traitor <personname> roared
<personname> please said professor <personname>
told me ter take his motorbike ter get <personname> there
his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side there is nothing and no one that matters to  them anymore
nobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against <personname> once he was cornered
i i will never forget it
bodies everywhere
madam rosmerta let out a long sigh
it was unnerving
there was a small chink of glass on wood
one by one the pairs of feet in front of <personname> took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam rosemertas glittering heels disappeared behind the bar
why had nobody ever told him
said <personname>s voice uncertainly
he could hear though having no idea what <personname>s voice might sound like a low excited mutter
<personname> slumped into a chair next to the fire
like trying to go after <personname> said <personname> sharply
<personname> and <personname> shook their heads looking apprehensive
<personname> is not affected by azkaban like normal people are
<personname>s a madman <personname> and he is dangerous  <personname>s dad must have told him said <personname> ignoring <personname>
he was right in <personname>s inner circle   say you-knotu-who will you
<personname>s pocket quivered
there is a weird noise he said
<personname> called <personname> thumping the door
<personname> are you in there
you have heard
<personname> allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard
i bet he will get off  you don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal of dangerous creatures choked <personname> wiping his eyes on his sleeve
<personname> howled still more loudly
fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on <personname> s knee
i have not bin meself lately said <personname> stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other
an them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an all said <personname> with a sudden shudder
i used ter hope i would jus die in me sleep
i don ever want ter go back ter azkaban
the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant
a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of <personname>s pocket to sniff hopefully at the air
<personname> had
its handle glittered as he picked it up
he cannot go giving students stuff like this  that is why he would not say it was from him said <personname>
what  are you two laughing about
no idea said <personname>
said <personname>
<personname> and <personname> looked at her
said <personname>
get him out of here <personname> bellowed as crookshanks s claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder
<personname> seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of <personname>s bed knocking it over and causing <personname> to hop up and down howling with pain
the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle <personname>s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor
i never wear those socks if i can help it
it is stress said <personname>
merry christmas said <personname> as <personname> <personname> and <personname> approached the table
crackers said <personname> enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to <personname> who took it reluctantly and tugged
she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonfly
sibyll this is a pleasant surprise said <personname> standing up
if you must know <personname> i have seen that poor professor <personname> will not be with us for very long
full to bursting with christmas dinner and still wearing their party hats <personname> and <personname> got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly
my dears which of you left his seat first
<personname> went straight up to the dormitory collected the firebolt and the broomstick servicing kit <personname> had given him for his birthday brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do to the firebolt however there were no bent twigs to clip and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it
miss granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick <personname>
he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he did not know whether he would ever see it again
as far as he was concerned the stripping-down of a brand-new firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage
<personname> who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room
ah said wood his expression clearing
what you would better get a move on you know you cannot ride that shooting star against ravenclaw he got a firebolt for christmas said <personname>
i will make her see sense
ah yes said <personname> when <personname> reminded him of his promise at the end of class
and what are you tutting at us for
said <personname>
it is called the patronus charm
a dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward <personname> one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak
<personname> suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat
you heard <personname>
said <personname> in a strange voice
why you did not know my dad did you
he racked his brains
a thought had just occurred to him
<personname> turned very quickly
<personname>s face relaxed
terrible though it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times <personname> had heard their voices since he was a very small child
but he would never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again
you would better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cup
then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it
he screwed up his face and imitated professor <personname>s severe voice
as long as necessary wood  i reckon it is time you ordered a new broom <personname>
<personname> felt angry with himself guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices again
make them disappear  the true patronus does do that said <personname>
here you have earned a drink something from the three broomsticks
as an empty she will
and your soul is gone forever  lost
do you really think anyone deserves that
and <personname> do try and win will not you
speechless <personname> carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower
you know what we should make up with <personname>
he is trying to force entry to the chambers within oh shut up said <personname> as he and <personname> drew level with <personname>
where  would you get it <personname>
can i sit down then
look he yelled shaking the sheets in her face
<personname> looked down at the sheet <personname> was holding
there was something red on it
the firebolt turned with the lightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green and-gray blur <personname> turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air again <personname> i am letting the snitch out wood called
anyway good work everyone
madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat
they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond
their seeker <personname> was the only girl on their team
<personname> dived <personname> saw what he was doing and tore after him <personname> was speeding up excitement flooding him dives were his speciality he was ten feet away then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere <personname> veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanished
gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go <personname>s really putting it through its paces now see it turn <personname>s comet is just no match for it the firebolts precision-balance is really noticeable in these long  jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts
something silver-white something enormous erupted from the end of his wand
in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground
<personname> got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field <personname> in the lead
lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were <personname> <personname> <personname> and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes
a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor <personname> about this make no mistake ah here he comes now if anything could have set the seal on gryffindors victory it was this
party gryffindor common room now right said <personname> and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castle
of course i did said <personname> in a strangely high pitched voice not looking up
if she just acted like she was sorry but she will never admit she is wrong <personname>
the gryffindor party ended only when professor <personname> turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed
it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves
<personname> was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his face
professor <personname> told us to go to bed a few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling on dressing gowns and yawning
in our dormitory with a knife woke me up the common room went very still
ask him if he saw  glaring suspiciously at <personname> professor <personname> pushed the portrait back open and went outside
<personname>s grudge no one in gryffindor tower slept that night
professor <personname> came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped
sir cadogan had been fired
none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him
<personname> tore open the envelope while <personname> helped herself to some of <personname>s cornflakes
wait for me in the entrance hall you are not allowed out on your own cheers <personname> he probably wants to hear all about <personname> said <personname>
all right <personname> said <personname>
spose you want to hear about saturday night do you
buckbeaks case against the committee fer the disposal of dangerous creatures said <personname>
they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare buckbeaks defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds
i got something ter discuss with you two said <personname> sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious
what dyou reckon
he added quietly to <personname> as they went to sit down
you have not even been inside zonkos yet <personname> looked around to check that <personname> was well out of earshot
said <personname>
<personname> was hanging around
the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain
his pale face split in a malevolent grin
we were just discussing your friend <personname> <personname> said to <personname>
<personname>s head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silver-blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck
<personname> had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard
who did that
<personname> <personname> said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where <personname> had disappeared you would better run for it if <personname> tells anyone you would better get back to the castle quick  see you later said <personname> and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade
<personname> would get back first  how long would it take him to find a teacher
come with me <personname> said <personname>
<personname> however remained standing
if he is seeing things like  what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade <personname>
had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts
turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out <personname> cold with dread <personname> slowly pulled out the bag of zonkos tricks and the marauders map
<personname> turned it over his eyes on <personname>
so said <personname> his long nostrils quivering
is this another treasured gift from mr <personname>
<personname> clenched his hands to stop them from shaking
<personname> was taking deep calming breaths
<personname> stared dumbstruck at the message
more writing was appearing beneath the first
mr prongs agrees with mr moony and would like to add that professor <personname> is an ugly git
it would have been very funny if the situation had not been so serious
we will see about this
i want a word utterly bewildered <personname> stared at the fire
i have just asked <personname> to empty his pockets
an odd closed expression appeared on <personname>s face
<personname> looked up and by the merest half-glance in <personname>s direction warned him not to interrupt
nor apparently did <personname>
he <personname> and <personname> walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking
i am however astounded that you did not hand it in
i cannot make you take <personname> seriously
it is my fault said <personname> abruptly
i will not forget all the help you gave us
and he was a bit useless
their only chance of talking to him was during care of magical creatures lessons
sall my fault
look at him blubber <personname> <personname> and <personname> had been standing just inside the castle doors listening
<personname> stepped backward
<personname> looked around too
they passed the security trolls gave the fat lady the password flibbertigibbet and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room
i reckon you are cracking up
it was hard to tell whether professor trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow
perhaps if we are lucky some of you will see before the end of the class
<personname> at least felt extremely foolish staring blankly at the crystal ball trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it
it is obvious what this means
<personname> felt his heart sinking
fine she repeated swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking <personname> off his chair
did not you professor
the inner eye can be a burden you know
even without divination she was taking more subjects than anybody else
when he was not flying it he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to gryffindor tower at break times to check that it was still there
oliver wood was crouched over a model of a quidditch field in the corner prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself
you have got a firebolti said <personname>
it could not be the grim not now not right before the match he peered out at the grounds again and after a minutes frantic searching spotted it
crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt
<personname> was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too
and just then it emerged a gigantic shaggy black dog moving stealthily across the lawn crookshanks trotting at its side
<personname> and the rest of the gryffindor team entered the great hall the next day to enormous applause
and here are the gryffindors yelled lee jordan who was acting as commentator as usual
he is made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill  more boos from the slytherin crowd
flint and wood approached each other and grasped each others hand very tightly it looked as though each was trying to break the others fingers
sorry said flint as the crowd below booed
superb very difficult to pass very difficult indeed yes i do not believe it he is saved it relieved <personname> zoomed away gazing around for the snitch but still making sure he caught every word of lees commentary
sixty-ten
<personname> was not going to let <personname> anywhere near the snitch
aaaaaaarrrgh   they scattered as the firebolt zoomed toward them angelinas way was clear
he was gaining on <personname> <personname> flattened himself to the broom handle as bole sent a bludger at him he was at <personname>s ankles he was level <personname> threw himself forward took both hands off his broom
<personname> soared above the crowd an odd ringing in his ears
professor <personname> was sobbing harder even than wood wiping her eyes with an enormous gryffindor flag and there fighting their way toward <personname> were <personname> and <personname>
words failed them
but they could not
as <personname> hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades
in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than <personname> was <personname>
snapped <personname> picking up the exam schedule and examining it
buckbeaks appeal it is set for the sixth
that is the day we finish our exams said <personname> still looking everywhere for her arithmancy book
it was all <personname> could do to stop himself imitating <personname> and hitting <personname> in the face on these occasions
and the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see <personname> because the strict new security measures had not been lifted and <personname> did not dare retrieve his invisibility cloak from below the one-eyed witch
k k k exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over the castle
wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a baking-hot sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next day when it would all be over
<personname> said <personname> startled
p p professor <personname> <personname> gasped pointing into the trunk
lovely day said <personname> casting an eye over the lake
they have even got the axe ready this is not justice <personname> your dad works for the ministry you cannot go saying things like that to his boss said <personname> but she too looked very upset
nope said <personname> in an offhand voice
she says the crystal balls told her that if i tell you i will have a horrible accident squeaked <personname> as he clambered back down the ladder toward <personname> and <personname> who had now reached the landing
he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with <personname>
finally after about twenty minutes <personname>s large feet reappeared on the ladder
do not think she was convinced though
he thought of what <personname> had just said and decided to pretend
are you sure
you do not see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it
no said <personname> starting to feel slightly sick
his servant has been chained these twelve years
tonight before midnight  the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master
professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled
<personname>
my dear boy that is hardly something to joke about
rise again indeed  but you just said it you said the dark <personname>  i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawney
or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test
<personname> told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch
how do you open the witchs hump again
she had
he is tethered in me pumpkin patch
there is another one in the cupboard <personname> said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve
he told  them buckbeaks all right but they are scared
great man <personname>
silent tears were now streaming down <personname> s face but she hid them from <personname> bustling around making tea
scabbers said <personname> blankly
they are cornin
next to him trotted <personname>
they followed him to the door into his back garden
<personname> we cannot  well tell them what really happened  they cannot kill him  go said <personname> fiercely
<personname> looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight
i cannot stand it i cannot bear it
he was writhing with all his might trying to break free of <personname>s grip
get away from him get away scabbers come here  there was a loud thud
come on and keep your wand out  they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail
all <personname> could think of was <personname> and what the enormous dog might be doing to him
and then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone
it was a room a very disordered dusty room
<personname> looked around
at that moment there was a creak overhead
something had moved upstairs
quietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase
a mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows
<personname>s and <personname>s wands shot out of their hands high in the air and <personname> caught them
your father would have done the same for me
if <personname> wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for <personname>s parents
now was the moment to avenge his mother and father
he was going to kill <personname>
who was <personname> talking about
then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at <personname>
<personname> edged away from both of them dragging his leg
i have not been helping <personname> said <personname>
was it a trick
<personname> said suspiciously
no we were not i could not believe my eyes said <personname> still pacing and ignoring <personname>s interruption
no one was with us said <personname>
two of you
what
you are both mental
all right then <personname> said without taking his eyes off the rat
i am off
because  because people would know if <personname> had been an animagus
all five of them stared at it
none of this could have happened if i had not been bitten  and if i had not been so foolhardy
<personname> started to interrupt but <personname> said shh she was watching <personname> very intently
i was a very small boy when i received the bite
my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure
i am able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane again
even now when the house has been silent for years the villagers do not dare approach it
and they did not desert me at all
it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it
my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with them
<personname> and <personname> transformed into such large animals they were able to keep a werewolf in check
and that is how we came to write the marauders map and sign it with our nicknames
<personname> is padfoot
i sometimes felt guilty about betraying <personname>s trust of course  he had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety
he was forbidden by <personname> to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i was
<personname> felt as though he would received a huge electric shock
i have just been to your office <personname>
i shall be interested to see how <personname> takes this
give me a reason to do it and i swear i will
do not talk about what you do not understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at <personname>s face
up to the castle
i do not think we need to go that far
perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too  before he knew what he was doing <personname> had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door
both <personname> and <personname> had tried to disarm <personname> at exactly the same moment
you should not have done that said <personname> looking at <personname>
<personname> bent down quickly and untied him
how did you find out where he was
when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper
he is got a toe missing said <personname>
did not you ever wonder why he was living so long
i supposed he bit himself
well faking his own death had worked once
he said he killed them he was pointing at <personname> who shook his head slowly the sunken eyes were suddenly overbright
<personname> had already retrieved <personname>s wand from the bed
together
he said quietly
on the count of three
you have got to help me <personname>
i a spy for <personname>
<personname> wiped his face again he was almost panting for breath
<personname> would be sure to come after me would never dream they would use a weak talentless thing like you
said <personname> timidly
can can i say something
keeping an ear out for news were not you <personname>
he seemed to have lost the ability to talk
<personname> jumped at being addressed like this and stared at <personname> as though he had never seen anything quite like her
the guards say he is been talking in his sleep  always the same words  he is at hog warts
i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog
you fly as well as your father did <personname>
you would not  you will not  gasped <personname>
but <personname> was staring at <personname> with the utmost revulsion
i was a good pet
<personname> <personname> would not have wanted me killed
you would been passing information to him for a year before <personname> and <personname> died you were his spy he he was taking over everywhere gasped <personname>
only innocent lives <personname> you do not understand whined <personname>
bandages spun up <personname>s leg strapping it tightly to a splint
<personname> helped him to his feet <personname> put his weight gingerly on the leg and did not wince
what about professor <personname>
you are free said <personname>
yes   said <personname>
you mean it
the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at <personname>s parents wedding
the grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distant windows of the castle
and then a cloud shifted
then his limbs began to shake
his shoulders were hunching
hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws
expelliarmusv <personname> yelled pointing his own wand at <personname> <personname>s wand flew high into the air and out of sight
he was crouched on all fours his hands over his head
i am going to go and live with him
at the same moment <personname> felt <personname> collapse next to him
expecto expecto patronum  <personname> felt his knees hit the cold grass
a paralyzing terror filled <personname> so that he could not move or speak
they were leaving
he could not think anymore
they were not responsible for their actions
and yet is it good for him to be given so much special treatment
and any other student would be suspended at the very least for leading his friends into such danger
extraordinary
<personname>s red hair was visible beneath madam pomfreys arm
<personname>s innocent <personname> faked his own death we saw him tonight you cannot let the dementors do that thing to <personname> he is  but <personname> was shaking his head with a small smile on his face
said <personname>
we are not confunded <personname> roared
<personname> showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed
what is he talking about
what are we supposed to do
here  she had thrown the chain around his neck too
what are we doing
yes said <personname> her ear still glued to the cupboard door
<personname> sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxious but <personname> wanted a few questions answered
but  <personname> i do not understand what <personname> wants us to do
<personname> just said just said we could save more than one innocent life
<personname> we are going to save buckbeak but how will that help <personname>
does not sound like anyones there
well run for it said <personname> determinedly
<personname> had appeared in his doorway shaking and white looking around to see who had knocked
let us move along a bit <personname> whispered
it is okay beaky it is okay   <personname> said to buckbeak
there was a knock on <personname>s front door
the execution party had arrived
<personname> watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating
out outside <personname> croaked
i will make it quick
quietly  quietly   as witnessed below
buckbeak move <personname> hissed
the footsteps stopped
<personname> heaved on the rope
<personname> looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight they could not see <personname>s garden at all
come in come in
gotchcd get off you stinking cat  there is <personname> said <personname>
that was crookshanks pressing the knot said <personname>
the moment they disappeared the tree began to move again
they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view
the tree stopped fighting and <personname> too disappeared into the gap in its roots
a large bottle was swinging from his hands
they watched <personname> meander tipsily up to the castle
his head drooped sadly
he knew who he thought it had been  but how could it have been
did not you see what they looked like
he was not a teacher
i know it sounds crazy said <personname> flatly
but he was not really watching buckbeak
buckbeak raised his head
we must not be seen
i cannot see what is going on we will not know when it is time  <personname> looked up
he had to know
<personname> threw himself behind it peering desperately through the leaves
it was cantering back toward <personname> across the still surface of the water
it was shining brightly as the moon above  it was coming back to him
i knew i could do it this time said <personname> because i would already done it
buckbeak bored was ferreting for worms again
buckbeak soared straight into the dark air
he is there <personname> said spotting <personname> as they rose up beside the window
<personname> looked up
okay buckbeak up said <personname> shaking the rope
buckbeak pawed the ground tossing his sharp head
<personname>
he and his rider became smaller and smaller as <personname> gazed after them  then a cloud drifted across the moon
as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices
<personname> panted
<personname> has gone on buckbeak
really they will wake everybody up what do they think they are doing
you cannot apparate or disapparate inside this castle this has something to do with <personname> <personname> be reasonable <personname> has been locked up bam
professor <personname> shrieked madam pomfrey
where is <personname>
neither <personname> nor <personname> felt like going however so they and <personname> wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where <personname> and buckbeak were now
what
said <personname> his smile fading a little
he is packing
said <personname> looking surprised that <personname> had to ask
i saw you coming said <personname> smiling
they will not want a werewolf teaching their children <personname>
that must never happen again
it is no use to me and i daresay you <personname> and <personname> will find uses for it
and so we would have said <personname> now reaching down to close his case
why so miserable <personname>
he said quietly
terrible
greater and more terrible than ever before  professor trelawneys prediction professor <personname> yesterday when i was having my divination exam professor trelawney went very very strange
how could <personname> take this so calmly
but i stopped <personname> and professor <personname> from killing <personname> that makes it my fault if <personname> comes back it does not said <personname> quietly
except for the eyes  you have your mothers eyes
<personname> meanwhile had much to say on the subject of <personname>s escape
if i manage to get into the ministry i will have a lot of proposals to make about magical law enforcement he told the only person who would listen his girlfriend penelope
though the weather was perfect though the atmosphere was so cheerful though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping <personname> to freedom <personname> had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits
for maybe half an hour a glorious half hour he had believed he would be living with <personname> from now on  his parents best friend
gryffindor house meanwhile largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the quidditch cup had won the house championship for the third year running
i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the job
i will write again soon
i <personname> <personname>s godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekends
that will be good enough for <personname> said <personname> happily
crookshanks purred
elderly mr and mrs <personname> had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown-up son <personname> had been if anything worse
the hanged man the village pub did a roaring trade that night the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders
he likes the quiet life
but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station <personname> was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the <personname>s deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger dark-haired and pale
the police had never read an odder report
and if he had any decency he would leave here knowing as how we knows he did it
but <personname> did not leave
they knew that old <personname>s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them
standing at the sink filling the kettle he looked up at the <personname> house and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows
it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over
the the quidditch world cup my <personname>
forgive me but i do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is over
<personname> tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely still
how am i to survive without you when i need feeding every few hours
who is to milk nagini
then the second man spoke once more in a whisper that was almost a hiss
i i thought she might be useful my <personname>  liar said the second voice again the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever
wormtail muttered something so quietly that <personname> could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speech
out in the corridor <personname> suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat
one more murder  my faithful servant at hogwarts  <personname> is as good as mine wormtail
something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake at least twelve feet long
in-indeed my <personname>
where are your manners
though still deeply shaken <personname> took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold
you heard everything muggle
<personname> is it
wormtail come turn my chair around
the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug
he opened his mouth and let out a scream
the scar <personname> lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running
he sat up one hand still on his scar the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table
he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door
it was all becoming confused
<personname> took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there
<personname> walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop
he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below
and yet  and yet  <personname> went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again
it was not the pain that bothered him <personname> was no stranger to pain and injury
the same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward
and yet it was because of <personname> that <personname> had come to live with the <personname>s in the first place
i mean  you would know would not you
mrs <personname> would fuss worse than <personname> and <personname> and george <personname>s sixteen-year-old twin brothers might think <personname> was losing his nerve
somehow <personname> found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why <personname> had gone south
dear <personname> thanks for your last letter
things are the same as usual here
my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday
a weird thing happened this morning though
say hello to buckbeak for me
however at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle <personname> and aunt <personname> could explain away
so after many tantrums after arguments that shook <personname>s bedroom floor and many tears from aunt <personname> the new regime had begun
the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks <personname> had sent <personname> to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently
in the living room
this just arrived said uncle <personname>
who did he know who sent letters by the postman
look at this he growled
his uncles eyes flashed
to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs <personname>s letter again
who is this woman
<personname> frowned
quidditch he muttered under his breath
<personname> saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky
he hissed his face now a rich plum color
gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the <personname>s stupid rules
he was not following <personname>s diet and he was not going to let uncle <personname> stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it
he had said the magic words
he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words
if he told <personname> he could not go to the quidditch world cup <personname> would write and tell <personname> who would know <personname> was being mistreated
he was going  he was going to the <personname>s he was going to watch the quidditch world cup outside in the hall he nearly ran into <personname> who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear <personname> being told off
that was an excellent breakfast was not it
laughing at the astonished look on <personname>s face <personname> took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom
he went back to the letter we are coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you cannot miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon it is better if we pretend to ask their permission first
see you five of the clock tomorrow
<personname> told her
it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even <personname>
back to the burrow by twelve of the clock the next day <personname>s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from <personname> the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by <personname> and <personname> last year
<personname> had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with a curly pigs tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt <personname> and uncle <personname> had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london
but mr <personname> had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today
probably mistaken the day
but <personname> did not seem able to speak
hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen
<personname> hurried into the living room
gasped aunt <personname> who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire
<personname> can you hear us
i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get <personname>
<personname> could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared <personname> out of the kitchen
<personname> edged along the wall gazing at mr <personname> with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father
mr <personname> however seemed genuinely concerned at <personname>s peculiar behavior
having a good holiday <personname>
their faces cracked into identical evil grins
<personname> go just go mr <personname> shouted his wand on uncle <personname>
did he eat it
it was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to
you dropped it on purpose roared mr <personname>
if it is got anything to do with <personname>s wizard wheezes  why do not you show <personname> where he is sleeping <personname>
it was brilliant i never knew they would been inventing all that  we have been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said <personname>
what are you working on
as <personname> <personname> and <personname> followed <personname> up three more flights of stairs shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them
it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly
because he is being stupid said <personname>
pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage hooting shrilly
<personname>s enjoying work then
have you had a good summer <personname>
they had only gone a few paces when <personname>s bandy-legged ginger cat crookshanks came pelting out of the garden bottle-brush tail held high in the air chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs
we are just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports
it is got to be ireland said <personname> thickly through a mouthful of potato
bulgaria has got <personname> though said <personname>
that was embarrassing that was
at the foot of <personname>s mattress he saw two large disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets
<personname> knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another but had never known any hogwarts student to do it and understood that it was very difficult
it is not easy apparition and when it is not done properly it can lead to nasty complications
he asked startled
we have got a bit of a walk said mr <personname>
<personname> came over the crest of the hill last clutching a stitch in her side
there are not any more of us in this area are there
they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor
after about twenty minutes a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view
<personname> two tents booked a couple of days ago
ah right certainly  said mr <personname>
this ones a a a ten
aye he said thoughtfully
like a big party
and ludo bagmans not helping
trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice not a worry about anti-muggle security
you could not wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though
he played quidditch for england himself you know
however here and there was a tent so obviously magical that <personname> could hardly be surprised that mr roberts was getting suspicious
right he said excitedly no magic allowed strictly speaking not when we are out in these numbers on muggle land
does not camp much anymore poor fellow he is got lumbago
well need water
they made their way slowly through the rows staring eagerly around
as they drew level with him his mother came hurrying out of the tent
ny times kevin
said <personname> grinning
the ministrys not too happy
when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland they set off again though as <personname> said like we would say anything else surrounded by that lot
i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents
the picture was of course moving but all it did was blink and scowl
he is a genius you wait until tonight you will see
just put them on archie there is a good chap
next they were hailed by ernie macmillan a hufflepuff fourth year and a little farther on they saw <personname> a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team
mr <personname> was having no success at all in lighting the fire but it was not for lack of trying
there was plenty to watch while they waited however
that was cuthbert mockridge head of the goblin liaison office
and that is bode and croaker  they are unspeakables
the man of the moment ludo ludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person <personname> had seen so far even including old archie in his flowered nightdress
ahoy there bagman called happily
he is just started at the ministry and this is <personname> no george sorry that is <personname> <personname> <personname> <personname> my daughter <personname> and <personname>s friends <personname> and <personname>
poor old bertha  memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction
she will wander back into the office sometime in october thinking it is still july
<personname> was a great believer in rigidly following rules and mr <personname> had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager <personname> doubted even uncle <personname> would have spotted him for what he really was
the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top box
oh is that what they are after
mr <personname> heaved a deep sigh
well they will never replace brooms in britain will they
he spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law
fairly said mr <personname> dryly
still it is not as though we have not got anything to look forward to eh <personname>
it is classified information until such time as the ministry decides to release it said <personname> stiffly
mr <personname> was quite right not to disclose it
bargain ten galleons each
you will not be getting anything for christmas <personname> told him thrusting omnioculars into his and <personname>s hands
fair enough said <personname> grinning
they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium
ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year
every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year they have suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again  bless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards
the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple
the bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with built-in anti-burglar buzzer  mrs skowers all-purpose magical mess remover no pain no stain  gladrags wizardwear london paris hogsmeade  <personname> tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them
did sir just call me <personname>
freedom is going to <personname>s head sir said winky sadly
said <personname>
well why should not he be paid
said <personname> frowning
mr <personname> kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards
<personname> jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog
when <personname> the minister of magic himself arrived <personname> bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered
they had met before and <personname> shook <personname>s hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him
ah <personname> said mr <personname> holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic
and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well he is the bulgarian minister of magic and he cannot understand a word i am saying anyway so never mind
mr <personname> and mr <personname> looked at each other and <personname> vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight
surely your house would not have fetched this much
mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries <personname>
mr <personname>s eyes had returned to <personname> who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him
everyone ready
veelal what are veel
this puzzled <personname> for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine moon bright like that or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind  but then the music started and <personname> stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at all
and as the veela danced faster and faster wild half formed thoughts started chasing through <personname>s dazed mind
something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it excellent yelled <personname> as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats
he looked like an overgrown bird of prey
<personname> yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars
they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one anothers minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on <personname>s chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet moran
fingers in your ears bellowed mr <personname> as the veela started to dance in celebration
she was half right at the very last second <personname> pulled out of the dive and spiraled off
it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee
mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistle
foul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of green
<personname> wanted someone to realize that <personname> was injured even though he was supporting ireland <personname> was the most exciting player on the field
<personname> his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his hand
he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up
you can speak english said <personname> sounding outraged
one by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with <personname>
he was slightly duck footed and distinctly round-shouldered
yes i owe you  how much
9 the dark mark  do not tell your mother you have been gambling mr <personname> implored <personname> and george as they all made their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs
when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr <personname> agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in
from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang
the singing had stopped
he could hear screams and the sound of people running
then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked
<personname> chuckled softly
he said lazily
i suppose your daddy told you all to hide
he was thinking of <personname> every time he had tried to do something the <personname>s would not like the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up
perhaps there was truth in what <personname> had said perhaps <personname> was in more danger than they were
they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite
<personname> looked around
even by the feeble light of the two wands <personname> could see that a great change had come over bagman
he no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced there was no more spring in his step
he is always said he would like to get something on him
they will said <personname> reassuringly
do you think they have been drinking or are they just  but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder
who is there
what the
as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellation
stupefyl roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and <personname> felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing
which of you conjured the dark mark
bit embarrassing mr <personname> said grimly looking down at winkys unconscious form
the dark marks a wizards sign
why were not you at the match
your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet
but why
i found her holding one ludo
she caught sight of mr <personname>s feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky
do you know who i am
excuse me
i is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose
winkys got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at <personname> and <personname> appealing for their support
it did not sound anything like winky did it
yeah it was a human voice said <personname>
winky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr <personname> raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with <personname>s
where would she have learned it
he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her
i i is finding it  finding it there sir
elf
there was no pity in his gaze
i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her masters reputation
mr <personname> calling her elf all the time  and mr <personname> he knows she did not do it and he is still going to sack her he did not care how frightened she would been or how upset she was it was like she was not even human well she is not said <personname>
who conjured it
we found <personname> <personname>s elf holding <personname>s wand but we are none the wiser about who actually conjured the mark
what
said <personname> impatiently
said <personname>
though it probably was he added hopelessly
half the muggle killings back when <personname> was in power were done for fun
your guess is as good as ours <personname> said mr <personname>
he used magic to pack up the tents and they left the campsite as quickly as possible passing mr roberts at the door of his cottage
they walked back through ottery st
ouch mum you are strangling us  i shouted at you before you left mrs <personname> said starting to sob
ah  of course  <personname>
last week she was saying we are wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness when we should be stamping out vampires as if it was not specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the guidelines for the treatment of non-wizard part humans  do us a favor perce said <personname> yawning and shut up
i am mentioned said mr <personname> his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the daily prophet article
mrs <personname> said <personname> suddenly unable to contain himself <personname> has not arrived with a letter for me has she
on saturday morning i woke up with my scar hurting again
i told you she went into a trance a real one
good thinking said <personname> his expression clearing
we all need to go to bed
i have been putting out fires all week
scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders
asked <personname> who was mending her copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi with spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire
eight of the hands were currently pointing to the home position but mr <personname>s which was the longest was still pointing to work
well it is a bit long dear said mrs <personname> gently
said mrs <personname> shrewdly
a few moments later mr <personname> came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray
i told bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago
mr <personname> has been saying it for weeks and weeks said <personname> swiftly
said <personname> hotly
pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered
<personname> poked a few owl treats through the bars of pigwidgeons cage then turned to his trunk
it is been over a week <personname> said looking at <personname>s deserted perch
yeah i suppose
pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge owl treat
<personname> urgent message from the ministry <personname> flattened himself against the wall as mr <personname> came clattering past with his robes on back to-front and hurtled out of sight
when <personname> and the others entered the kitchen they saw mrs <personname> rummaging anxiously in the drawers i have got a quill here somewhere and mr <personname> bending over the fire talking to <personname> shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly
more likely there is a very she will shocked cat wandering around somewhere covered in potato peelings
<personname> did not use his wand
i will bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window said mr <personname> but they will have a job proving it there are not any casualties
said <personname>
said <personname>
i just cannot justify taking more time off at the moment he told them
<personname> tried to borrow ministry cars for us mrs <personname> whispered to <personname> as they stood in the rain washed yard watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy hogwarts trunks into their cars
nor did it help that a number of filibusters fabulous wet-start no-heat fireworks went off unexpectedly when <personname>s trunk sprang open causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as crookshanks clawed his way up the mans leg
crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks and by the time they entered london <personname> <personname> and <personname> were all severely scratched
i might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it
what dyou three know that we do not
it is going to be very exciting mind you i am very glad they have changed the rules  what rules
and you george
but mrs <personname> only smiled and waved
<personname> undid his trunk pulled out his maroon dress robes and flung them over pigwidgeons cage to muffle his hooting
father actually considered sending me to durmstrang rather than hogwarts you know
durmstrangs another wizarding school
evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door which dean and <personname> had left ajar
<personname> howled with derisive laughter <personname> and <personname> guffawed stupidly
<personname> repeated
a gleeful smile spread across <personname>s pale face
do not tell me you do not know
fathers always associated with the top people at the ministry
oooh i would not fancy crossing the lake in this weather said <personname> fervently shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd
leaning against the window <personname> could see hogwarts coming nearer its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain
peeves yelled an angry voice
into the great hall come on <personname> <personname> and <personname> slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right <personname> muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face
oh no not necessarily said <personname>
you would think they would be together would not you
<personname> looked up at the staff table
said <personname> who was also looking up at the teachers
they had never yet had a defense against the dark arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms
the words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the great hall opened and silence fell
professor <personname> was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the hall
now each of these four founders formed their own house for each did value different virtues in the ones they had to teach
that is not the song it sang when it sorted us said <personname> clapping along with everyone else
it is got to be a pretty boring life has not it being a hat
when the hat announces your house you will go and sit at the appropriate table
colin i fell in he said shrilly throwing himself into an empty seat
the sorting continued boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the three-legged stool the line dwindling slowly as professor <personname> passed the ls
pritchard graham slytherin quirke orla ravenclaw and finally with whitby kevin hufflepuff the sorting ended
<personname> had knocked over her golden goblet
over a hundred
slave labor
and she refused to eat another bite
so said <personname> smiling around at them all
he looked around at <personname> and george his fellow members of the quidditch team
i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts  but at that moment there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the great hall banged open
he seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone
must be said <personname> in a low awed voice
what happened to him
<personname> whispered
as i was saying he said smiling at the sea of students before him all of whom were still gazing transfixed at <personname> <personname> we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months an event that has not been held for over a century
ah yes the triwizard tournament  well some of you will not know what this tournament involves so i hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation and allow their attention to wander freely
we have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger
an impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the triwizard cup the glory of their school and a thousand galleons personal prize money
<personname> <personname> <personname> <personname> and george set off for the entrance hall <personname> and george debating the ways in which <personname> might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament
fancy entering
she said as they approached
five four poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls each with its owners trunk at the foot
<personname> <personname> the storm had blown itself out by the following morning though the ceiling in the great hall was still gloomy heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as <personname> <personname> and <personname> examined their new course schedules at breakfast
divination was his least favorite subject apart from potions
there was a sudden rustling noise above them and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail
they need squeezing
you will collect the pus i say in these bottles
wear your dragon hide gloves it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted bubotuber pus
should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples
eurgh squealed <personname> jumping backward
first pus and now this muttered <personname>
its end exploded said dean angrily showing <personname> a burn on his hand
i reckon they are the males
<personname> began to eat so fast that <personname> and <personname> stared at her
said <personname>
<personname> and <personname> walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room and sat down at the same small circular table
<personname> <personname> muttered
he sat up straight he had been almost dozing off lost in the heat and his thoughts
i have got two neptunes here said <personname> after a while frowning down at his piece of parchment that cannot be right can it
your dads in the paper <personname> said <personname> brandishing a copy of the daily prophet and speaking very loudly so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear
unsurprisingly mr <personname> found upon arrival at mr <personname> s heavily guarded house that mr <personname> had once again raised a false alarm
<personname> was shaking with fury
said <personname> both he and <personname> had grabbed the back of <personname>s robes to stop him from launching himself at <personname> that expression she is got like she is got dung under her nose
oh no you do not laddie <personname> spun around
professor <personname> was limping down the marble staircase
did he get you
<personname> started to limp toward <personname> <personname> and the ferret which gave a terrified squeak and took off streaking toward the dungeons
he got to his feet wincing
<personname> we never use transfiguration as a punishment said professor <personname> weakly
well i know your father of old boy
said <personname> in surprise
he could have really hurt <personname> though she said
within five minutes she had cleared her plate and departed
how cool is he
what was it like
said <personname>
the unforgivable curses the next two days passed without great incident unless you counted <personname> melting his sixth cauldron in potions
you know why <personname> s in such a foul mood do not you
been in the  library
you can put those away he growled stumping over to his desk and sitting down those books
<personname> took out a register shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face and began to call out names his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around fixing upon each student as he or she answered
i have got one year to teach you how to deal with dark  what are not you staying
now according to the ministry of magic i am supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that
gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one time the imperius curse
<personname> felt <personname> recoil slightly next to him <personname> hated spiders
he growled
you would like it would you if i did it to you
another illegal curse
there is one the cruciatus curse said <personname> in a small but distinct voice
your names <personname>
engorgio the spider swelled
abandoning all pretense <personname> pushed his chair backward as far away from <personname>s desk as possible
no sound came from it but <personname> was sure that if it could have given voice it would have been screaming
you do not need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the cruciatus curse
said <personname> looking at her
it started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface
<personname> stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it but not really seeing it at all
but that does not matter
now  those three curses avada kedavra imperius and cruciatus are known as the unforgivable curses
that is what you are up against
get out your quills  copy this down
oh hello he said his voice much higher than usual
said <personname>
but an odd clunking noise sounded behind them and they turned to see professor <personname> limping toward them
said <personname> watching <personname> and <personname> turn the corner
you know her just put in loads of misery she will lap it up
yeah you will be said <personname> darkly we are seeing the skrewts again on monday
good one said <personname> copying it down
okay i will lose a bet
he had thought then that it was another order form for <personname>s wizard wheezes but it did not look like that this time if it had been they would surely have let lee jordan in on the joke
as <personname> watched george shook his head at <personname> scratched out something with his quill and said in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room no that sounds like we are accusing him
<personname> sat down laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair and pulled <personname>s predictions toward her
not going to have a very good month are you
oh am i
i would better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff
said <personname>
what is this about
not spew said <personname> impatiently
our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use and trying to get an elf into the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures because they are shockingly underrepresented
<personname> asked
<personname> hastily untied it and sat down to read whereupon <personname> fluttered onto his knee hooting softly
what does it say
coming back because he thinks i am in trouble and there is nothing wrong with me and i have not got anything for you <personname> snapped at <personname> who was clicking her beak expectantly you will have to go up to the owlery if you want food
beauxbatons and drumstrang early next morning <personname> woke with a plan fully formed in his mind as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night
it took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him as she kept shuffling around on her perch showing him her tail
before the dementors do
you said to use it against another human was  <personname> wants you taught what it feels like said <personname> his magical eye swiveling onto <personname> and fixing her with an eerie unblinking stare
he had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping the result was that he would smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over and by the feeling in his legs fractured both his kneecaps
all the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term
professor <personname> explained why when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of transfiguration homework she had assigned
maybe not thomas but believe me you need all the preparation you can get miss granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion
professor flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms
you will do whayer told he growled or i will be takin a leaf outta professor <personname>s book
<personname> flushed with anger but apparently the memory of <personname>s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting
lessons will end half an hour early brilliant said <personname>
i wonder if <personname> knows
he must be entering the tournament
you just do not like him because he beat gryffindor at quidditch said <personname>
excuse me i do not like people just because they are handsome said <personname> indignantly
rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs who was going to try for hogwarts champion what the tournament would involve how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselves
he cannot avoid us forever
<personname> asked george
thought any more about trying to enter
what are you on about
true both of them had paid two sickles for a spew badge but they had only done it to keep her quiet
george however leaned in toward <personname>
a snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he is hiding  i mean they are not native birds are they
<personname> rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before
there was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day
parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait
or they could apparate maybe you are allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from
he remembered what mr <personname> had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup always the same we cannot resist showing off when we get together
and then <personname> called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers aha unless i am very much mistaken the delegation from beauxbatons approaches where
something large much larger than a broomstick or indeed a hundred broomsticks was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle growing larger all the time
a few people gasped
my dear madame <personname> he said
dumbly-dorr said madame <personname> in a deep voice
a few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads
<personname> said leaning around <personname> and parvati to address <personname> and <personname>
wonder what is up with them
what seemed to be a long black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool  and then <personname> saw the rigging
people were disembarking they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ships portholes
really <personname> said loftily as they passed the girls now squabbling over the lipstick
nope they are upstairs in my bag said <personname>
three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads
why did not they bring cloaks
too late said <personname> bitterly
he was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion
no ones making you stay <personname> whispered bristling at her
the house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than <personname> had ever seen including several that were definitely foreign
<personname> s fingers
the girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the ravenclaw table
<personname> examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely then moved it carefully a few inches to his right so that it would be clearly visible from the ravenclaw table
the triwizard tournament is about to start
just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year
the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr <personname> and mr bagman said <personname> as <personname> placed the chest carefully on the table before him and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge
they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup
anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet said <personname>
<personname> s eyes moved slowly up <personname>s face and fixed upon his scar
a terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him
<personname> asked a third year girl eagerly
i would have if it had been me  would not have wanted everyone watching
what if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again
what
we only need to be a few months older
cmon then i will go first  <personname> watched fascinated as <personname> pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words <personname> hog warts
he surveyed <personname> and george his eyes twinkling
as it was halloween a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner
people were cheering out in the entrance hall
they all swiveled around in their seats and saw angelina johnson coming into the hall grinning in an embarrassed sort of way
thought you lotd forgotten where i live we have been really busy hag  <personname> started to say but then she stopped dead looking up at <personname> apparently lost for words
they are gettin massive mus be nearly three foot long now
still got abou twenty
you would be makin  them unhappy ter take away their work an insultin  them if you tried ter pay  them
by half past five it was growing dark and <personname> <personname> and <personname> decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the halloween feast and more important the announcement of the school champions
said <personname> turning around with a large bottle in his hand
getting to their feet very cautiously so that <personname> would not spot them <personname> <personname> and <personname> peered through the window and saw that madame <personname> and the beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage clearly about to set off for the feast too
<personname> was walking side by side with <personname> and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them
next moment a tongue of flame shot into the air a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it the whole room gasped
<personname> caught the piece of parchment and held it at arms length so that he could read it by the light of the flames which had turned back to blue-white
well we now have our three champions
sparks were flying out of it
a long flame shot suddenly into the air and borne upon it was another piece of parchment
and then <personname> cleared his throat and read out  <personname>
<personname> turned to <personname> and <personname> beyond them he saw the long gryffindor table all watching him openmouthed
he just stood there looking at the three champions
<personname> looked nonplussed
he gave a short and nasty laugh
do not go blaming <personname> for <personname>s determination to break rules
when he spoke however it was in his usual curt voice
his face wore a very ugly look indeed
after all our meetings and negotiations and compromises i little expected something of this nature to occur i have half a mind to leave now empty threat <personname> growled a voice from near the door
so you will understand if we do not take you entirely seriously
ah but dumbly-dorr  my dear madame <personname> if you have an alternative i would be delighted to hear it
courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard  very important
i think so said <personname> who was looking at mr <personname> with mild concern
i did not said <personname> staring up at him
<personname> could tell <personname> did not believe him
but someone else had considered it  someone else had wanted him in the tournament and had made sure he was entered
was <personname> just being his usual paranoid self
but how could <personname> have ensured that <personname>s name got into the goblet of fire
how did you do it without getting a beard
lee jordan had unearthed a gryffindor banner from somewhere and he insisted on draping it around <personname> like a cloak
insisting that he needed to sleep and almost flattening the little creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs <personname> managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could
oh hello said <personname>
there was definitely something wrong with the way <personname> was smiling it was more like a grimace
i did not put my name in that goblet said <personname> starting to feel angry
you are doing a really good impression of it <personname> snapped
then the memory of the previous night rolled over him
because <personname>s right <personname>  i do not think any student could have done it  they would never be able to fool the goblet or get over <personname> s  have you seen <personname>
what is that supposed to mean not really
i know it is not your fault she added quickly seeing <personname> open his mouth furiously
tell him from me he is welcome to it
he will probably come bursting right into the castle if i tell him someone is entered me in the triwizard tournament  he would want you to tell him said <personname> sternly
ill be really surprised if there is not anything in the daily prophet about you competing
then they returned to the castle
this is not my fault
course i do <personname> grunted
no longer she will-less and colorless they had developed a kind of thick grayish shiny armor
the next few days were some of <personname>s worst at hogwarts
nevertheless it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides
you just were not concentrating properly wonder why that was said <personname> darkly as <personname> walked past surrounded by a large group of simpering girls all of whom looked at <personname> as though he were a particularly large blast-ended skrewt
the injustice of it made him want to curse <personname> into a thousand slimy pieces
i want you to brew them carefully and then we will be selecting someone on whom to test one
the experts upstairs now with <personname>
er  said <personname>
let us see  ah yes this is nice and cozy
<personname> looked down quickly at the quill
reluctantly <personname> looked up at her instead
said <personname>
excited
well  they say it is going to be a lot safer this year said <personname>
er said <personname> yet again
the weighing of the wands is about to start and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard
hmmm  he said
i find it makes for rather temperamental wands  however to each his own and if this suits you  mr ollivander ran his fingers along the wand apparently checking for scratches or bumps then he muttered  orchideousv and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip
it is in fine condition
you treat it regularly
<personname> looked down at his own wand
a fine wand maker though the styling is never quite what i  however  he lifted the wand and examined it minutely turning it over and over before his eyes
<personname> had waved what felt like every wand in the shop until at last he had found the one that suited him this one which was made of holly eleven inches long and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix
thank you all said <personname> standing up at the judges table
all the judges and champions what do you think <personname>
and then perhaps some individual shots
the photographs took a long time
<personname> was not there he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed
however someone seems to be having a good try
the shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in
he had never suffered nerves like these they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a quidditch match not even his last one against slytherin which had decided who would win the quidditch cup
much of the front page had been given over to a picture of <personname> the article continuing on pages two six and seven had been all about <personname> the names of the beauxbatons and durmstrang champions misspelled had been squashed into the last line of the article and <personname> had not been mentioned at all
i know they would be very proud of me if they could see me now
yes sometimes at night i still cry about them i am not ashamed to admit it
want a hanky <personname> in case you start crying in transfiguration
since when have you been one of the top students in the school <personname>
<personname> had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too but she had not yet started yelling at innocent bystanders in fact <personname> was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation
you miss him <personname> said impatiently
<personname> liked <personname> very much but she just was not the same as <personname>
<personname> often complained about <personname> being there not that he ever bothered them but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves and <personname> found the noise distracting
quite apart from liking to get quidditch terms correct it caused him another pang to imagine <personname>s expression if he could have heard <personname> talking about wonky faints
come on please just take off your cloak for a bit no ones going to bother you here
talking in low voices they passed right by <personname> without looking at her
when they were gone <personname> said she is staying in the village
on his way through the pub <personname> spotted <personname> who was sitting with <personname> george and lee jordan
ernie macmillan and hannah abbott were swapping <personname>colate frog cards at a nearby table both of them sporting support <personname> badges on their cloaks
the back of <personname> s enormous shaggy head he had mercifully abandoned his bunches emerged over the crowd
<personname> had his usual enormous tankard in front of him but <personname> was drinking from his hip flask
he waved then remembered that <personname> could not see him
hello said <personname> smiling back
<personname> stared at him in amazement
said <personname> looking startled
he was very curious to know what this might be <personname> had never asked <personname> to visit him so late at night
<personname> hurried to follow and found to his great surprise that <personname> was leading him to the beauxbatons carriage
she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders
ah agrid  it is time
he could see her any old time he wanted  she was not exactly hard to miss
of course not said madame <personname> fluttering her long black eyelashes
i did not know you were bringing her <personname> <personname> said frowning
vicious thing
trusting to the fact that <personname> would not miss him with the attractions of four dragons and madame <personname> to occupy him he turned silently and began to walk away back to the castle
<personname> sped up skirting the edge of the forest he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to <personname> and he could not remember ever wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now when without warning he ran into something very solid
he recognized the goatee  it was <personname>
<personname> remained still and silent
he might even have spotted <personname> and madame <personname> heading off around the forest together they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance  and now all <personname> had to do was follow the sound of voices and he like madame <personname> would know what was in store for the champions
instead his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days he scrambled out of his chair crouched down by the hearth and said <personname> how  are you doing
<personname> he was a death eater
he is not very popular in there i can tell you
but  are you saying <personname> put my name in the goblet
i have been hearing some very strange things he said slowly
someone set off the dark mark  and then did you hear about that ministry of magic witch who is gone missing
very nosy but no brains none at all
you think <personname> might be here on his orders
they will just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff
but you can do it alone said <personname>
who had decided to go for a stroll at one of the clock in the morning and stopped <personname> from telling him how to get past a dragon
what are you doing down here at this time of night
should have realized you did not want to be disturbed
you might even have a scar now if you are lucky
talon-clipping by charms  treating scale-rot  this is no good this is for nutters like <personname> who want to keep them healthy
i would say transfigure it but something that big you really have not got a hope i doubt even professor <personname>  unless you are supposed to put the spell on yourself
but they are not simple spells i mean we have not done any of those in class i only know about them because i have been doing owl practice papers
said <personname> irritably as <personname> slouched in cast a surly look over at the pair of them and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books
when he awoke on monday morning he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts
my bag just split  brand-new and all  <personname> said <personname> the first task is dragons
what
said <personname> looking up
he asked
<personname> followed him wondering what was going to happen to him now
well it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret <personname> thought dully he would be smaller much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet  he followed <personname> into his office
sit down said <personname> and <personname> sat looking around
on his desk stood what looked like a large cracked glass spinning top <personname> recognized it at once as a sneakoscope because he owned one himself though it was much smaller than <personname>s
been humming ever since i got here
it is extra-sensitive picks up stuff about a mile around
i did not cheat said <personname> sharply
said <personname>
think now
the books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping like stones to the floor
at two of the clock in the morning <personname> stood near the fireplace surrounded by heaps of objects books quills several upturned chairs an old set of gobstones and <personname>s toad trevor
accio dictionary  the heavy book soared out of <personname> s hand flew across the room and <personname> caught it
<personname> had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning charm that evening that some of his blind panic had left him
he left the great hall with professor <personname>
<personname> was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool
<personname> looked even surlier than usual which <personname> supposed was his way of showing nerves
he was wearing his old wasp robes again
perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths that was certainly how <personname> felt
he did not even blink just sat back down and stared at the ground
outside
<personname> had now taken to retracing <personname>s steps around and around the tent
he saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream
<personname> soared higher in a circle the horntail was still following his progress its head revolving on its long neck if he kept this up it would be nicely dizzy but better not push it too long or it would be breathing fire again <personname> plummeted just as the horntail opened its mouth but this time he was less lucky he missed the flames but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead and as he swerved to the left one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder ripping his robes he could feel it stinging he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd but the cut did not seem to be deep
over there she is had to mop up <personname> already
you two are so stupid
then before either of them could stop her she had given both of them a hug and dashed away now positively howling
<personname> did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the ground  turned it into a dog  he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him
looking good <personname> yelled thumping <personname> on the back
and now <personname> raised his wand
it was <personname>
yeah you can have a word said <personname> savagely
the house-elf liberation f<personname>t <personname> <personname> and <personname> went up to the owlery that evening to find pigwidgeon so that <personname> could send <personname> a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed
now we know where they knew each other
did not work did it
<personname> went on as he carried pigwidgeon to the window
there were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface lee jordan had let off some filibusters fireworks so that the air was thick with stars and sparks and dean thomas who was very good at drawing had put up some impressive new banners most of which depicted <personname> zooming around the horntails head on his firebolt though a couple showed <personname> with his head on fire
open it <personname> go on let us just see what is inside it he is supposed to work out the clue on his own <personname> said swiftly
it is in the tournament rules
this was unhelpful as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them
i am not sure whether they hibernate or not <personname> told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson
but the skrewts it transpired did not hibernate and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in
<personname> was leaning on <personname> s garden fence looking in at the mayhem
who  are you
i have never heard of them before  where do they come from
oh yeah  ouch  interesting said <personname> as she stepped on his foot
been teaching long
share some of your experience of magical creatures
just as long as he did not import those skrewts illegally or anything said <personname> desperately
i meant best
<personname> and <personname> laughed and feeling slightly more cheerful went off to lunch
<personname> she panted skidding to a halt beside him the fat lady stared down at her eyebrows raised
he had one brief glimpse of an enormous high ceilinged room large as the great hall above it with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls and a great brick fireplace at the other end when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room squealing <personname> sir <personname>i next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break
he was wearing a tea cozy for a hat on which he had pinned a number of bright badges a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest a pair of what looked like childrens soccer shorts and odd socks
one of these <personname> saw was the black one <personname> had removed from his own foot and tricked mr <personname> into giving <personname> thereby setting <personname> free
said <personname>
at the moment they were clear of food dinner having finished but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above
<personname> stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed
winky was sitting on a stool by the fire
then she burst into tears which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front just as they had done at the quidditch world cup
she and <personname> had followed <personname> and <personname> to the end of the kitchen
how long have you been here <personname>
winky forgets she is not bound to mr <personname> anymore she is allowed to speak her mind now but she will not do it
but <personname> is not wanting to <personname> he said talking normally again and shaking his head so that his ears flapped
but you can say what you like about the <personname>s now
<personname> <personname> could he said doubtfully
<personname> stood for a moment quivering all over horror struck by his own daring then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard squealing  bad <personname>  bad <personname> <personname> seized <personname> by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table
squeaked winky and to <personname>s great surprise and <personname>s and <personname>s too by the looks on their faces she looked angry again
thanks a lot <personname> said to the elves who had all clustered around the door to say good night
<personname> coming to work here i mean
<personname> would not recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing <personname>s tea cozy
it was the end of the lesson they had finished their work the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on professor <personname>s desk <personname>s still had feathers they had copied down their homework from the blackboard describe with examples the ways in which transforming spells must be adapted when performing cross-species switches
now then  professor <personname> stared deliberately around the class
the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to er let our hair down she said in a disapproving voice
<personname> could see what was funny this time professor <personname> with her hair in a tight bun looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense
oh yes you do said professor <personname> irritably
a week ago <personname> would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a hungarian horntail
this year however everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying and they all seemed to <personname> to be obsessed with the coming ball or at least all the girls were and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold he had never quite noticed that before
why do they have to move in packs
how are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them
lasso one
said <personname>
exactly who or what the weird sisters were <personname> did not know never having had access to a wizards wireless but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn wizarding wireless network that they were a very famous musical group
it is christmas <personname> said <personname> lazily he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire
<personname> said as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger toward a ballycastle bats chaser
<personname> can we borrow pigwidgeon
angelina said <personname> promptly without a trace of embarrassment
what
<personname> we have just got to grit our teeth and do it said <personname> on friday morning in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress
she said okay and followed him out of earshot of her classmates
who  are you going with
oh <personname> she said
completely forgetting about dinner he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower <personname>s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took
<personname> looked up at <personname> a sort of blind horror in his face
said <personname>
what was i playing at
he told me after potions said she is always been really nice helping him out with work and stuff but she told him she was already going with someone
said <personname> loftily
<personname> <personname>s right you are a girl
no you are not said <personname>
he asked me when <personname> said no and i thought  well  i am not going to be able to go otherwise i am not in fourth year
yes all right then she said finally blushing furiously
she said keenly
of course they are did you expect me to keep those fangs <personname> gave me
well  when i went up to madam pomfrey to get them shrunk she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were she said
keep in touch i still want to hear about anything unusual
<personname> he sounds exactly like <personname> said <personname> quietly tucking the letter away again inside his robes
then spotting the look on <personname> s face he said come on howm i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on
oh i suppose not she sighed and she sat down to watch their chess match which culminated in an exciting checkmate of <personname>s involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop
<personname> pulled back the curtains around his four poster took his glasses from his bedside table and put them on
it was a lie he had not bought anything for <personname> at all but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks
said <personname> grinning over from his own bed which was now strewn with wrapping paper
he threw <personname> a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped and the hand-knitted sweater mrs <personname> had sent
they went out onto the grounds in the afternoon the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the durmstrang and beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle
he yelled after <personname> but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle
i still cannot work out how you two got the best looking girls in the year muttered dean
animal magnetism said <personname> gloomily pulling stray threads out of his cuffs
thanks she said
the entrance hall was packed with students too all milling around waiting for eight of the clock when the doors to the great hall would be thrown open
parvati found her sister padma and led her over to <personname> and <personname>
when they had disappeared <personname> stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd
the oak front doors opened and everyone turned to look as the durmstrang students entered with professor <personname>
once everyone else was settled in the hall professor <personname> told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her
the house tables had vanished instead there were about a hundred smaller lantern-lit ones each seating about a dozen people
padma was looking sulky
tm afraid to say mr <personname> is not well not well at all
he is not as young as he was though still quite brilliant of course the mind remains as great as it ever was
ve have just four floors and the fires are lit only for magical purposes
<personname> all this secrecy  one would almost think you did not want visitors
only this morning for instance i took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room i have never seen before containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots
<personname> snorted into his plate of goulash
<personname> frowned but <personname> could have sworn <personname> had given him a very small wink
<personname> had the impression that davies was too busy staring at <personname> to take in a word she was saying
he kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor so that the champions were no longer the center of attention
let us sit down shall we
he was glaring at <personname> and <personname> who were dancing nearby
every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at <personname> who was completely ignoring her
it is hot is not it
<personname> what
he is from durmstrang spat <personname>
he is <personname>s student is not he
for your information he has not asked me one single thing about <personname> not one  <personname> changed tack at the speed of light
padma asked him
said a voice
made friends with <personname> have you <personname>
what
<personname> and <personname> continued down the path
what is got <personname> all worried
said <personname> slowly
instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeers back but the beetle just was not interesting enough to block out <personname>s next words
i jus knew  knew you were like me
it was my mother said <personname> quietly
by the time i was six i could lift him up an put him on top of the dresser if he annoyed me
<personname>s deep voice broke
sorta had ter make me own way after that
said <personname> blankly
her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn behind him <personname> heard <personname> and roger fall out of their rosebush
then after about a minute he stood up and strode away not back to the castle but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin
he whispered
so what
now however he could tell that most wizards would not have said so what
yeah
you know that golden egg
<personname> had to yell fairy lights before he woke them up and when he did they were extremely irritated
it is just bigotry is not it
who  are you
what is up with him
professor grubbly-plank acted as though she could not hear him
how did she get it
what dyou reckons wrong with him
<personname> has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation however
professor grubbly-planks voice carried over to the boys the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now stroking it
<personname> was so angry that the daily prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn whose many magical properties professor grubbly-plank was now enumerating in a loud voice so that the boys could hear too
you do not think <personname> told her
we would have seen her in the garden said <personname>
this evening after divination
so that evening after dinner the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to <personname>s cabin
open up <personname> did not answer
he surely does not think we would care about him being half-giant
he kept whispering to <personname> whenever there was a teacher around so that he was safe from <personname>s retaliation
said <personname> looking impressed
he is mad said <personname> staring at <personname>s dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake
he had not mentioned <personname> since the ball but <personname> had found a miniature arm under his bed on boxing day which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch robes
does not he ever go into the office
in a moment in a moment <personname> heard him say brusquely to the goblins and bagman hurried through the pub toward <personname> his boyish grin back in place
er okay said <personname> and he and <personname> went off to find a table
bagman led <personname> along the bar to the end furthest from madam rosmerta
their english is not too good  it is like being back with all the bulgarians at the quidditch world cup  but at least they used sign language another human could recognize
they  er  they are looking for barry <personname>
said <personname>
have you heard anything about bertha jorkins
and then she left the cousins house to go south and see an aunt  and she seems to have vanished without trace en route
we are supposed to work out the clues alone are not we
good luck <personname>
well i do not think <personname> would like it if he knew bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat said <personname> still looking deeply disapproving
who cares if <personname>s getting help
those goblins did not look very friendly said <personname> sipping her butterbeer
maybe <personname>s poisoning him said <personname>
probably thinks if <personname> snuffs it he will be made head of the department of international magical cooperation
<personname> gave <personname> a do not -joke-about-things-like that look and said funny goblins looking for mr <personname>
<personname> asked <personname>
<personname> had just entered
and what is he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway
think we should do a bit of digging
<personname> s eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken
what did you do that to <personname> for eh
she will be after you next <personname> said <personname> in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street
let her try said <personname> defiantly she was shaking with rage
why do not you come in
i just meant <personname> how could you think we would care what that woman wrote about you
come back and teach <personname> said <personname> quietly please come back we really miss you
gives  them second chances  thas what sets him apar from other heads see
the incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on <personname>s conscience that evening and by the time he had got into bed he had made up his mind it was time to shelve his pride and see if <personname>s hint was worth anything
the egg and the eye as <personname> had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg he decided to do it at night when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted
however the moonlit corridors were empty and silent and by checking the map at strategic intervals <personname> was able to ensure that he would not run into anyone he wanted to avoid
long white linen curtains hung at the windows a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner and there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall
it fluttered every time she snored
this was true though only because <personname> <personname> and <personname> had found <personname>s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew polyjuice potion in secret a forbidden potion that had turned him and <personname> into living replicas of <personname> and <personname> for an hour so that they could sneak into the slytherin common room
it took three more underwater renditions of the eggs song before <personname> had it memorized then he trod water for a while thinking hard while <personname> sat and watched him
he lay there talking to himself for ages about it
ages and ages  nearly all the bubbles had gone
<personname>  what lives in the lake apart from the giant squid
i remember at her brothers wedding  but <personname> was not listening he was thinking about the merpeoples song again
what were they going to take
<personname> had taken his first step back toward gryffindor tower when something else on the map caught his eye  something distinctly odd
<personname> watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room pausing here and there
<personname> s footsteps halted there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped <personname> had picked up the egg and closed it
any moment now <personname> was going to pull aside the tapestry expecting to see peeves  and there would be no peeves  but if he came up the stairs he would spot the marauders map  and invisibility cloak or not the map would show <personname> standing exactly where he was
hiding are you
<personname> gritted his teeth convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second
i yes professor but  <personname> looked yearningly up the stairs right through <personname> who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering peeves
<personname> stopped talking very abruptly
did i hear that correctly <personname>
he asked slowly
it is unimportant said <personname> coldly
reckon they were after potion ingredients eh
<personname> saw the edge of <personname> s sallow face turn a nasty brick color the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly
<personname> suddenly did something very strange
<personname> <personname> snarled and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where <personname> was as though he could suddenly see him
i have seen it before i recognize it <personname> is here <personname> in his invisibility cloak <personname> stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs <personname> could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating trying to sniff <personname> out trapped <personname> leaned backward trying to avoid <personname>s fingertips but any moment now there is nothing there <personname> barked <personname> but i will be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to <personname> meaning what
<personname> turned again to look at <personname> his hands still outstretched inches from <personname>s chest
got <personname>s best interests at heart have you
<personname> was left staring down at <personname> who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him a dull clunk on every other step
what is this thing
he looked suddenly alarmed
he said
well he is not here anymore said <personname> his eye still whizzing over the map
<personname> was burning to know more
he said again
this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention
yeah i do not fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head said <personname>
here take my quill and send this owl back straight away
he had been so intent on telling <personname> all about <personname> and <personname> he had completely forgotten to mention the eggs clue
cmon move in a bit you can pat  them if you want  give  them a few of these sugar lumps
i am not worried at all
you are going ter be fine
he looked after everything else on the grounds after all you are going ter win <personname> growled patting <personname>s shoulder again so that <personname> actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground
by the evening before the second task <personname> felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare
how could he have let this happen
<personname>s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word water on a page but more often than not it was merely take two pints of water half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves and a newt  i do not reckon it can be done said <personname>s voice flatly from the other side of the table
her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of olde and forgotten bewitchments and charmes with her nose about an inch from the page
they have said <personname>
there is a way of doing it <personname> said crossly
an animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal
<personname> asked
looking for you said george
was professor <personname> about to tell <personname> and <personname> off
perhaps she would noticed how much they were helping him when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone
the common room emptied slowly around <personname>
people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery confident voices like <personname>s all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task
he had searched all the remaining books and <personname> and <personname> had not come back
it is over he told himself
<personname> croaked
it was twenty past nine
hurry <personname> squeaked <personname> plucking at <personname>s sleeve
you has to eat this sir squeaked the elf and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy grayish-green rat tails
<personname> heard professor <personname> and professor <personname> in the staffroom talking about the next task
<personname> bent over hands on his knees gasping for breath he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs but there was no time to get rid of it ludo bagman was now moving among the champions spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet
one  two  three the whistle echoed shrilly in the cold still air the stands erupted with cheers and applause without looking to see what the other champions were doing <personname> pulled off his shoes and socks pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket stuffed it into his mouth and waded out into the lake
his head had stopped spinning he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills sending oxygen back to his brain
he stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them
he could only see ten feet around him so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness forests of rippling tangled black weed wide plains of mud littered with dull glimmering stones
once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him but when he got nearer he discovered it to be nothing but a large blackened log or a dense clump of weed
<personname> <personname> tried to shout but once again nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble
i do not like them much they always chase me when i get too close
he swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear
the merman laughed and shook his head
he began to hack at the ropes binding <personname> and after several minutes hard work they broke apart
there was no sign of any of the other champions
and i do not want them to die either <personname>s head was on <personname> s shoulder the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale
but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head
darting forward <personname> hit <personname> hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone
<personname> pulled out his wand
their yellowish eyes were fixed upon <personname>s wand and they looked scared
<personname>s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging <personname> and the girl
it was ze grindylows  zey attacked me  oh gabrielle i thought  i thought  come here you said madam pomfrey
he attempted to engage <personname> in conversation again but she was too busy cheering <personname> to listen
padfoot returns one of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake which meant that <personname> was getting to share <personname>s limelight for once
i could have taken those mer idiots any time i wanted
what were you going to do snore at them
people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that <personname> would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood
be at stile at end of road out of hogsmeade past dervish and banges at two of the clock on saturday afternoon
<personname> folded up the letter thinking
<personname> <personname> and <personname> were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with pansy parkinsons gang of slytherin girls
<personname> <personname> and <personname> headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual
<personname> and <personname> leaned in closer
i told you <personname> hissed at <personname> as she stared down at the article
<personname> had glided over to their desk while they were talking
a boy like no other perhaps   <personname> could feel his face burning
<personname> that table in front of my desk
determined not to look at <personname> <personname> resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles imagining each one to have <personname>s face
so i give you fair warning <personname> <personname> continued in a softer and more dangerous voice pint-sized celebrity or not if i catch you breaking into my office one more time  i have not been anywhere near your office said <personname> angrily forgetting his feigned deafness
everyone watched him as he walked up toward <personname> s desk
we need to talk said <personname> abruptly when he had reached <personname>
but you must have noticed  <personname> began in an agitated voice
<personname> turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon
they went into gladrags wizardwear to buy a present for <personname> where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly
what if you are seen
<personname> nudged <personname> and passed him the daily prophets
there were two the first bore the headline mystery illness of <personname> the second ministry witch still missing minister of magic now personally involved
<personname> scanned the story about <personname>
i bet he wishes he had not done it now bet he feels the difference now she is not there to look after him
i think he said he would been too busy
he stared at <personname>
who else was sitting behind you
yes there was there was ludo bagman <personname> reminded him
said <personname>
how dyou know
it is more likely he did it than winky said <personname> stubbornly
all these absences of <personname> <personname>s  he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the quidditch world cup but does not bother to turn up and watch
if he is ever taken a day off work because of illness before this i will eat buckbeak
<personname> fought violence with violence and authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against suspects
he had his supporters mind you plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of magic
but then something rather unfortunate happened
<personname>s son was caught
yep said <personname> throwing his chicken bone to buckbeak flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread and tearing it in half
he was screaming for his mother by nightfall
<personname> said
no he is not in there anymore
that was the last time i saw <personname> <personname> half carrying his wife past my cell
wasted away just like the boy
one moment a hero poised to become minister of magic  next his son dead his wife dead the family name dishonored and so i have heard since i escaped a big drop in popularity
there was a long silence
i think they have both got a point said <personname> looking thoughtfully at <personname> and <personname>
<personname> s always been fascinated by the dark arts he was famous for it at school
avery from what i have heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he would been acting under the imperius curse he is still at large
if he is why did he make the effort to drag himself up to <personname> s office
any chance you could ask him if he is seen <personname> lately
i can try said <personname> doubtfully
what is the time
yeah <personname> loves rules
poor old snuffles said <personname> breathing deeply
good idea said <personname>
her clothes were ragged and unwashed
begging your pardon miss said the house-elf bowing deeply again but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served
we has your extra food squeaked an elf at <personname>s elbow and he shoved a large ham a dozen cakes and some fruit into <personname>s arms
good-bye the house-elves crowded around <personname> <personname> and <personname> and began shunting them out of the kitchen many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs
<personname> got so tired of <personname> and <personname> sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took <personname>s food up to the owlery that evening on his own
<personname> leaned upon his spade but did not seem keen to prolong their talk because madame <personname> returned to the carriage shortly afterward
said <personname> seizing <personname> s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls all of whom were jostling close to her trying to deliver their own letter first
we will tell professor sprout where you have gone
i warned her said <personname> as <personname> hurried out of the great hall cradling her hands
<personname> ignored her he did not want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the witch weekly article had caused
but when he got near enough to see inside he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts
he pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth <personname> had watched him digging from the owlery window
<personname> told him about the hate mail she had received that morning and the envelope full of bubotuber pus
i got some of those letters an all after <personname> wrote abou me mum
what is the matter
oh  he said the memory coming back to him at last
you should not ve given me that chudley cannon hat for christmas
said <personname>
neither of them really knew what to say
i do not blame <personname> and george for trying to make some extra money
then when <personname> continued to look gloomy she said come on <personname> it could be worse
<personname> was getting sick of telling people that <personname> was not his girlfriend
<personname> had such a bad case of twitchy ears he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class
<personname> says he did not see her anywhere near the judges table at the second task or anywhere near the lake <personname> is there any point in telling you to drop this
<personname> however did not ask <personname> and <personname> to help her pursue vengeance against <personname> for which they were both grateful because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays
he was working flat-out just to get through all their homework though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for <personname> after last summer <personname> had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry
she asked quietly
<personname> asked her hastily
ludo bagman was standing in the middle of the field with <personname> and <personname>
then maze grunted <personname>
then mr <personname> will enter  then miss <personname>
bagman hurried alongside <personname> as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze
vill you valk vith me
bagman looked slightly perturbed
i vant to know he said glowering vot there is between you and hermy-own-ninny
it is just that <personname> woman making things up
vosnt he a judge
said <personname> staring at mr <personname>
is not he vith your ministry
okay said <personname> if you get up mr <personname> we can go up to the  i have done  stupid  thing  mr <personname> breathed
i am a student at the school said <personname> looking around at <personname> for some help but <personname> was hanging back looking extremely nervous
i  escaped  must warn  must tell  see <personname>  my fault  all my fault  bertha  dead  all my fault  my son  my fault  tell <personname>  <personname>  the dark <personname>  stronger  <personname>  i will get <personname> if you let me go mr <personname> said <personname>
<personname> tore up the stone steps through the oak front doors and off up the marble staircase toward the second floor
sher sherbet lemon he panted at it
<personname> shouted
no said <personname> swiftly
<personname> what the
he cried when he saw <personname> on the ground and <personname> and <personname> beside him
what is going on
i vos attacked said <personname> sitting up now and rubbing his head
<personname> <personname> began but <personname> had drawn himself up clutching his furs around him looking livid
in one swift movement <personname> seized the front of <personname>s furs lifted him into the air and slammed him against a nearby tree
apologize <personname> snarled as <personname> gasped for breath <personname>s massive fist at his throat his feet dangling in midair
ill leave fang with you headmaster <personname> said staring menacingly at <personname> who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree tangled in furs and tree roots
what were you doing wanderin off with ruddy <personname>
he seemed really weak i do not reckon he was up to disapparating or anything
okay  how is this for a theory said <personname> excitedly
he kept saying stuff was his fault
i have told you <personname> repeated dully
if <personname> had not held me up <personname> said bitterly we might have got there in time
would not put it past him <personname> muttered
<personname> and george came over the threshold then froze at the sight of <personname> <personname> and <personname>
<personname> and <personname> said at the same time
he walked over to <personname> pulled the letter out of his hands and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl
george carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off
<personname> <personname> and <personname> stared at one another
said <personname> looking skeptical
he would probably do a <personname> and turn them in
dyou think it is too early to go and see professor <personname>
he looked as tired as they felt
<personname> called as they made their way toward him through the crowd
hello <personname> growled <personname>
no said <personname>
well he was not invisible said <personname>
what
i am keeping an eye on things but all the same  you can never have too many eyes out
i am waiting for your letter giving me your word you will not stray out-of bounds again
it was extremely comfortable
if you will all look this way i will dim the lights
he was riding on the back of an eagle owl soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old ivy-covered house set high on a hillside
my <personname> i am  1 am so pleased  and so sorry
<personname> could see its tongue fluttering
now wormtail said the cold voice perhaps one more little reminder why i will not tolerate another blunder from you
they all looked unnerved
<personname> had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to <personname>s office without noticing
then he remembered that he did not know the password
he tried tentatively
he said angrily
how are you
yes said <personname>
he looked around
hello fawkes he said
for several minutes he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames thinking about what he had just heard and running his fingers over his scar
a shallow stone basin lay there with odd carvings around the edge runes and symbols that <personname> did not recognize
it was a bright whitish silver and it was moving ceaselessly the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind and then like clouds separated and swirled smoothly
he looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling
they seemed he thought to be waiting for something even though he could only see the tops of their hats all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction and none of them were talking to one another
he was falling through something icy-cold and black it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool and suddenly <personname> found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin a bench raised high above the others
not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst
and that in <personname>s opinion settled the matter
but what was this place
the man between them looked as though he was about to faint and <personname> could not blame him  he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory but he remembered their power only too well
i wish to be of use to the ministry
<personname> <personname> was sitting there except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance
you must understand said <personname> hurriedly that <personname> operated always in the greatest secrecy
he preferred that we i mean to say his supporters and i regret now very deeply that i ever counted myself among them  get on with it sneered <personname>
i i saw him torture countless muggles and and non-supporters of the dark <personname>
and helped him do it murmured <personname>
indeed
why yes  there was rosier said <personname> hurriedly
<personname> could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the ministry
the watching crowd was all murmuring together
i have given evidence already on this matter he said calmly
<personname> was sitting in a different seat still on the highest bench but now to the left side of mr <personname>
this was not however a ludo bagman gone to seed but a ludo bagman who was clearly at the height of his quidditch-playing fitness
<personname> could not believe his ears
but i have told you i had no idea bagman called earnestly over the crowds babble his round blue eyes widening
it will be put to the vote said mr <personname> coldly
he turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon
there was total silence broken only by the dry sobs of a frail wispy-looking witch in the seat next to mr <personname>
a nerve was twitching in his temple
he was shivering his straw-colored hair all over his face his freckled skin milk-white
take them away <personname> roared at the dementors spit flying from his mouth
<personname> did so staring at the stone basin
when he took the wand away hair seemed to be clinging to it but then <personname> saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the pensieve
i was using the pensieve when mr <personname> arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily
<personname> shook his head
when she spoke her voice echoed as <personname>s had done as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin
<personname> whispered looking up at her
before you got lost in my thoughts you wanted to tell me something
please continue
he said something like wormtails blunder had been repaired
he said someone was dead
the thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that <personname> could not make out anything clearly it was merely a blur of color
but  but then how could he have held the wand
said <personname> looking at <personname> over the pensieve
once again <personname> i can only give you my suspicions
silence fell between them again <personname> extracting thoughts every now and then
<personname> gave <personname> a very sharp look
so they are dead
no said <personname> his voice full of a bitterness <personname> had never heard there before
he had never known  never in four years bothered to find out  the <personname>s were very popular said <personname>
said <personname> slowly
and  er  but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him
this is what she meant is not it
who needs that sort of prejudice
we were going to do the impediment curse we will have to really get down to it tomorrow come on <personname> you need to get some sleep
as <personname> took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you
everyone was looking forward to the third task which would take place a week before the end of term
<personname>s nerves mounted as june the twenty-fourth drew closer but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks
for one thing he was confident that this time he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task
the post owls appeared bringing <personname> a good-luck card from <personname>
but before <personname> could demand to see the paper <personname> shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table
let me see it <personname> said to <personname>
on monday last midway through a divination lesson your daily prophet reporter witnessed <personname> storming from the class claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying
he might even be pretending said one specialist
there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago and most people thought <personname> was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy
how did she know your scar hurt in divination
she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair
she ran her fingers through her hair again and then held her hand up to her mouth as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie
exempt from the end-of-term tests as a triwizard champion <personname> had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far looking up fresh hexes for the third task
spose so <personname> said to <personname> but just then professor <personname> came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him
she does not expect the <personname>s to turn up does she
sir cadogan
said <personname>
beaten him once before have not you
they returned to the castle for lunch
oh  okay said <personname>
<personname> looked between them then said mrs <personname> you did not believe that rubbish <personname> wrote in witch weekly did you
bagman looked quite cheerful but <personname> who was sitting next to madame <personname> looked stern and was not talking
will the champions please follow mr bagman down to the stadium now
and in third place miss <personname> of beauxbatons academy <personname> could just make out mrs <personname> <personname> <personname> and <personname> applauding <personname> politely halfway up the stands
he waved up at them and they waved back beaming at him
point me he whispered to his wand holding it flat in his palm
surely he should have met something by now
twelve feet tall its face hidden by its hood its rotting scabbed hands outstretched it advanced sensing its way blindly toward him
he did the four-point spell again and found that he was going too far east
the spell shot straight through the mist leaving it intact
what would happen if he walked through the mist
<personname> was hanging from the ground with his hair on end his glasses dangling off his nose threatening to fall into the bottomless sky
he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there terrified
he would got this far had not he
and then <personname> heard <personname>s voice
crucio   the air was suddenly full of <personname>s yells
<personname> said roughly grabbing <personname>s arm
i heard him i turned around and he had his wand on me
he was still shaking
its head however was that of a woman
she turned her long almond-shaped eyes upon <personname> as he approached
he raised his wand hesitating
no she said continuing to pace
remain silent i will let you walk away from me unscathed
okay he said
now string them together and answer me this which creature would you be unwilling to kiss
could i have it again  more slowly
there were plenty of animals he would not want to kiss his immediate thought was a blast-ended skrewt but something told him that was not the answer
no that is not my guess a a spy
point mel he whispered again to his wand and it spun around and pointed him to the right hand one
<personname> was going to get there first
did it fall on you
you told me about the dragons <personname> said
you helped me with the egg we are square
<personname> was serious
he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house had not had in centuries
<personname> looked from <personname> to the cup
<personname> shook his head
they were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right
squinting tensely through the darkness they watched the figure drawing nearer walking steadily toward them between the graves
whoever it was he was short and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face
and several paces nearer the gap between them closing all the time <personname> saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby  or was it merely a bundle of robes
it was wormtail
the bundle of robes that <personname> had thought was a baby was close by at the foot of the grave
wormtails fast wheezy breathing was growing louder again
now  said the cold voice
the thing wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child except that <personname> had never seen anything less like a child
as he did so his hood fell back and <personname> saw the look of revulsion on wormtails weak pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron
and then wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron there was a hiss and it vanished below the surface <personname> heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud
bone of the father unknowingly given you will renew your son the surface of the grave at <personname>s feet cracked
he gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward
he staggered back to the cauldron with <personname>s blood
robe me said the high cold voice from behind the steam and wormtail sobbing and moaning still cradling his mutilated arm scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground got to his feet reached up and pulled them one-handed over his masters head
his hands were like large pale spiders his long white fingers caressed his own chest his arms his face the red eyes whose pupils were slits like a cats gleamed still more brightly through the darkness
<personname> slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand
he caressed it gently too and then he raised it and pointed it at wormtail who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where <personname> was tied he fell to the foot of it and lay there crumpled up and crying
oh master  thank you master  he extended the bleeding stump but <personname> laughed again
he whispered his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars
he did not like magic my father  he left her and returned to his muggle parents before i was even born <personname> and she died giving birth to me leaving me to be raised in a muggle orphanage  but i vowed to find him  i revenged myself upon him that fool who gave me his name  <personname>
yet they left gaps in the circle as though waiting for more people
they slipped back among my enemies and they pleaded innocence and ignorance and bewitchment
i do not forgive
you know that do not you
master  it is beautiful  thank you  thank you
your exploits at the quidditch world cup were fun i daresay  but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master
they were faithful
the dementors will join us  they are our natural allies  we will recall the banished giants  i shall have all my devoted servants returned to me and an army of creatures whom all fear
one too cowardly to return  he will pay
you know of course that they have called this boy my downfall
his mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice
i remember only forcing myself sleeplessly endlessly second by second to exist
but i dared not go where other humans were plentiful for i knew that the aurors were still abroad and searching for me
i did not manage to steal the sorcerers stone
and then not even a year ago when i had almost abandoned hope it happened at last  a servant returned to me
for hungry one night on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food  and who should he meet there but one bertha jorkins a witch from the ministry of magic
there was no hope of stealing the sorcerers stone anymore for i knew that <personname> would have seen to it that it was destroyed
i wanted <personname>s blood
i wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago  for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too
you have been taught how to duel <personname>
he knew he was facing the thing against which <personname> had always warned  the un-blockable avada kedavra curse and <personname> was right his mother was not here to die for him this time
<personname> rolled over and scrambled to his feet he was shaking as uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off he staggered sideways into the wall of watching death eaters and they pushed him away back toward <personname>
perhaps another little dose of pain
before <personname> could stick his snakelike face around the headstone <personname> stood up  he gripped his wand tightly in his hand thrust it out in front of him and threw himself around the headstone facing <personname>
the death eaters were shouting they were asking <personname> for instructions they were closing in reforming the circle around <personname> and <personname> the snake slithering at their heels some of them drawing their wands the golden thread connecting <personname> and <personname> splintered though the wands remained connected a thousand more beams arced high over <personname> and <personname> crisscrossing all around them until they were enclosed in a golden dome-shaped web a cage of light beyond which the death eaters circled like jackals their cries strangely muffled now
it was coming from every thread of the light spun web vibrating around <personname> and <personname>
it was a sound <personname> recognized though he had heard it only once before in his life phoenix song
it looked so solid emerged in its entirety from the end of <personname>s wand as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel  and this shade of <personname> stood up and looked up and down the golden thread of light and spoke
hold on <personname> it said
killed me that one did
it flew into the air and soared toward him
<personname>
that is right <personname>  just let go now
<personname> bent down and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin raised <personname> from the ground and set him on his feet
the man asked at last as he lifted <personname> up the stone steps
took me and <personname> to a graveyard  and <personname> was there  <personname>  clunk
and the death eaters came  and then we dueled
<personname> heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands
he looked as white as <personname> had looked and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon <personname>s face
<personname>s back <personname>
said <personname>
he forgave them then
tell me he told them that i i alone remained faithful  prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all  you
we will see we will see who is mad now that the dark <personname> has returned with me at his side he is back <personname> you did not conquer him and now i conquer you <personname> raised his wand he opened his mouth <personname> plunged his own hand into his robes stupefy there was a blinding flash of red light and with a great splintering and crashing the door of <personname>s office was blasted apart <personname> was thrown backward onto the office floor
he stepped into the office placed a foot underneath <personname>s unconscious body and kicked him over onto his back so that his face was visible
<personname> bent down over <personname>s limp form and put a hand inside his robes
then he turned to professors <personname> and <personname>
<personname> kindly go down to <personname>s house where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch
<personname> walked over to the trunk with seven locks fitted the first key in the lock and opened it
it contained a mass of spell-books
<personname> stared at him too
minutes passed in silence
can you hear me
<personname> asked quietly
the dementors are blind
everyone believed her to be me
then i had to be concealed
she pitied me
master <personname> master <personname> sobbed winky through her hands
did anybody ever discover that you were still alive
said <personname> softly
she came to investigate
when everyone had left the box we would emerge
i stole it
then we heard them
i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the sky
he searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there
she had failed him
she had let me acquire a wand
my father answered the door
it was very quick
and what did <personname> ask you to do
i was ready
i made the dustbins move around the yard
i kept him alive under the imperius curse
the other ingredients were easy
my master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house
said <personname> quickly
<personname> joined them
watched the map
my masters plan worked
<personname> could i ask you to stand guard here while i take <personname> upstairs
i want you to come up to my office first <personname> he said quietly as they headed up the passageway
<personname> rising from the steaming cauldron
professor <personname> mumbled where are mr and mrs <personname>
so tired every bone in his body was aching he wanted nothing more than to sit here undisturbed for hours and hours until he fell asleep and did not have to think or feel anymore
there was something comforting about his warm weight
<personname> was going to question him
he was going to make <personname> relive everything
said <personname> harshly
let him have a sleep
i ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time
it shivered in the air and <personname> felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach warming him and strengthening him
once or twice <personname> made a noise as though about to say something his hand still tight on <personname>s shoulder but <personname> raised his hand to stop him and <personname> was glad of this because it was easier to keep going now he had started
when <personname> told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger however <personname> let out a vehement exclamation and <personname> stood up so quickly that <personname> started
but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and <personname>s wands he found his throat obstructed
said <personname>
all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo
the last murders the wand performed said <personname> nodding
more would have appeared of course had you maintained the connection
i will say it again said <personname> as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door
they appeared to be demanding to know where <personname> was and what had happened to him
but i do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer and certainly not this evening
she rounded on <personname> <personname> and <personname> as though they were being noisy and hissed did you hear
<personname> felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to <personname> for asking the others not to question him
is he okay
<personname> <personname> <personname> mrs <personname> and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him
just tired
madam pomfrey who had bustled off to her office returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet
he felt himself becoming drowsy at once
<personname> opened his eyes blearily someone had removed his glasses
and that is <personname> <personname>s is not it
<personname> demanded of mrs <personname>
by all accounts he is no loss blustered <personname>
<personname> looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face
see here <personname> said <personname> and <personname> was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face you you cannot seriously believe that
i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office
<personname> reddened slightly but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face
you admit that he has been having these pains then
<personname> is as sane as you or i
he tried to get out of bed again but mrs <personname> forced him back
i saw the death eaters i can give you their names <personname>  <personname> made a sudden movement but as <personname> looked at him <personname>s eyes flew back to <personname>
also cleared now working for the ministry avery nott <personname> <personname>  you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago said <personname> angrily
but now a short angry wizard stood before him refusing point-blank to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world to believe that <personname> could have risen
the second step you must take and at once <personname> pressed on is to send envoys to the giants
what madness is this
you must act as you see fit
he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands
there said <personname> harshly
<personname> stepped back from <personname> too
<personname> thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride
tell him i will be in direct contact with him shortly
do what you can for her and take her back to the kitchens
<personname> made sure that the door was closed and that madam pomfreys footsteps had died away before he spoke again
yeah said <personname>
<personname> grasped his hand briefly nodded to <personname> transformed again into the black dog and ran the length of the room to the door whose handle he turned with a paw
<personname> slumped back against his pillows as <personname> disappeared
<personname> <personname> and mrs <personname> were all looking at him
you have a good long sleep
it was not your fault <personname> mrs <personname> whispered
the recollections he did have were very painful
he must have been happy
you take this he muttered to her
the only time they touched upon the subject was when <personname> told <personname> about a meeting mrs <personname> had had with <personname> before going home
said <personname>
course you are not
<personname> said nothing
knew he was going ter come back said <personname> and <personname> <personname> and <personname> looked up at him shocked
we will fight
<personname>s chest swelled as he looked at <personname>
now  who would like ter come an visit the las skrewt with me
<personname> wondered as he sat down with the other gryffindors where <personname> was now and whether <personname> had caught up with him
they were talking quietly together
pretended that he had never really gone over to <personname> that he had been like <personname> himself biding his time
<personname> was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish hufflepuff house <personname> continued
i am talking of course about <personname>
every guest in this hall said <personname> and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students will be welcomed back here at any time should they wish to come
differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open
<personname> smiled at him <personname> scowled
could i have a vord
even though i vos from durmstrang with <personname> he added scowling
<personname> <personname> and <personname> talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward
nothing about any of it
<personname> looked and saw that she was quite right
blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction deafened by a series of bangs <personname> blinked and looked down at the floor
well let us not leave them here they do not add much to the decor
exploding snap anyone
oh said george darkly
yeah that is what we thought at first
he put a bet on you mate said <personname>
<personname> pulled open his trunk and drew out his triwizard winnings
said <personname> looking flabbergasted
listen said <personname> firmly
<personname> closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer
he had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession
a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the <personname>s living room and as though <personname> had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword
there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows
gave <personname> and me quite a turn he continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned <personname> back toward him
aunt <personname>s thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle <personname>s wide purple one
well it changes every day you see said <personname>
get out of that one boy as if we did not know you get all your news from those pestilential birds <personname> hesitated for a moment
no more do i said uncle <personname> forcefully
he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mind
could <personname> be following him right at this very moment
had not he proved himself capable of handling much more than they
in the meantime he had nothing to look forward to but another restless disturbed night because even when he escaped nightmares about <personname> he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors all finishing in dead ends and locked doors which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake
the noble sport as uncle <personname> called it had made <personname> even more formidable than he had seemed to <personname> in the primary school days when he had served as <personname>s first punching bag
uncle <personname> had threatened to lock <personname> in the she would if he came home after <personname> again so stifling a yawn still scowling <personname> set off toward the park gate
shut it snarled <personname> turning away again
oh yeah
is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty <personname>s wand
the distant grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone
you moron <personname> <personname> yelled his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees now feeling around frantically in the blackness
mrs figg their batty old neighbor came panting into sight
her grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers
i am a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors
but come on i will be no help if they come back i have never so much as transfigured a teabag  she stooped down seized one of <personname>s massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged
<personname> took hold of <personname>s arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist <personname> to his feet
never mind the statute of secrecy now there is going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg
<personname> asked mrs figg panting with the effort to keep walking
it was not easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when <personname> hears about this how could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnight where is he
what appened to staying undercover
he gave the semiconscious <personname> a heave and staggered onward
the hall light was on
uncle <personname> was standing in front of the draining board glaring at <personname> through tiny narrowed eyes
he said in a menacing growl
slowly tremulously <personname> nodded
owls bellowed uncle <personname> the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut
where he was going to go <personname> did not know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand
you have got three seconds
ignoring uncle <personname>s anguished yell of owls <personname> crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open again
do not surrender your wand
a small shoot of hope burgeoned in <personname>s chest almost immediately strangled by panic how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic
his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here
oh this explains everything everything no wonder the countrys going to the dogs when <personname> did not respond uncle <personname> glared at him then spat and why have you been expelled
so you admit it what did you do to <personname>
said uncle <personname> in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a very ill person
and then  he gestured at his massive chest
so said uncle <personname> voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up
two of them
she glanced at uncle <personname> in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsey teeth
if you mean my mum and dad why do not you use their names
well
it is what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth
of course they did not get his soul you would know if they had said <personname> exasperated
fought  them off did you son
said uncle <personname> loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a plane he understood
it is you said uncle <personname> forcefully
he must have sent them said <personname> quietly more to himself than to uncle <personname>
he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment
out out i should have done it years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed <personname>s tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford anglia out out you have had it you are history you are not staying here if some loonys after you you are not endangering my wife and son you are not bringing trouble down on us if you are going the same way as your useless parents i have had it out <personname> stood rooted to the spot
get it over with it will happen anyway  no  aunt <personname>s hand was trembling
she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too late the envelope burst into flames
the boy the boy will have to stay <personname> she said weakly
w-what
we will have to keep him
but <personname> dear  aunt <personname> ignored him
<personname> copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom
whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen
why was he still trapped here without information
why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid
come here said <personname> picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg
<personname> gave a muffled hooting noise beak still full of frog
he would probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow
<personname> was filled alternately with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which he paced his bedroom again furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing
you are not to steal food from the fridge
i am going to lock your door
he sat bolt upright listening intently
he hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs
lower your wand boy before you take someone is eye out said a low growling voice
i do not know so much about professor  growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i
<personname> lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move
<personname>s heart leapt
one of the eyes was small dark and beady the other large round and electric blue the magical eye that could see through walls doors and the back of <personname>s own head
that is him <personname> said <personname>
do not put your wand there boy roared <personname>
we are just waiting for the signal to tell us it is safe to set off said <personname> glancing out of the kitchen window
said <personname>
<personname> asked
brooms said <personname>
most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he would tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside
yeah it does said <personname> decisively
said <personname> impressed
<personname> chuckled
he did not like people staring at his scar
metamorphmagi are really rare they are born not made
okay let us go
<personname>s trunk rose a few inches into the air
here you go  he rapped <personname> hard on the top of the head and <personname> felt a curious sensation as though <personname> had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck
<personname> lost track of time
<personname> touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square
got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it
<personname> and <personname> followed carrying <personname>s trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking them
a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin bags just inside the broken gate
read quickly and memorize
the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar
the silver door knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent
what dyou
pressing her finger to her lips she led him on tiptoes past a pair of long moth-eaten curtains behind which <personname> supposed there must be another door and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed trolls leg they started up the dark staircase passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall
did not work that well though did it
it did nothing to improve his temper
or that i cannot take care of myself  of course he does not think that said <personname> anxiously
me <personname> was standing there with his mouth half-open clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say while <personname> looked on the verge of tears
he shot at <personname> and <personname>
headquarters of the order of the phoenix said <personname> at once
it is the people who fought against <personname> last time
well what
only we have had to stop using them lately because mum found out and went berserk
he walked around the room again looking anywhere but at <personname> and <personname>
we have said <personname> quickly
we have managed to clean out the kitchen most of the bedrooms and i think we are doing the drawing room tomo aargh with two loud cracks <personname> and george <personname>s elder twin brothers had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room
you two passed your apparation tests then
you want to be careful said <personname> staring at the ear
he is on our side now said <personname> reprovingly
said george
<personname> asked
it is normally mum who shouts it was the first week back after term ended said <personname>
yeah i have said <personname>
<personname> hurried on well you would need to read it cover to cover to pick it up but they um they mention you a couple of times a week
what dyou
it is quite nasty actually said <personname> in a voice of forced calm
which is what
they were back on the hearing and <personname> did not want to think about it
<personname> gave the extendable ear a hearty tug there was another loud crack and he and george vanished
and who is left all those dungbombs outside the kitchen door
the sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed
look  he muttered but <personname> shook his head and <personname> said quietly we knew you would be angry <personname> we really do not blame you but you have got to understand we did try and persuade <personname>  yeah i know said <personname> grudgingly
he asked
the house-elf who lives here said <personname>
<personname> dear if you will just tiptoe across the hall it is through this door here  crash
has not anyone told you
i offered it to <personname> for headquarters about the only useful thing i have been able to do
he followed his godfather to the bottom of the stairs and through a door leading into the basement kitchen
mundungus mumbled sleepily
do not know what you are complaining about myself
you think you have had it bad at least you have been able to get out and about stretch your legs get into a few fights i have been stuck inside for a month
crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness
<personname> did not feel the need to apparate every few feet <personname> did not charm everything he met <personname>  she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression was suddenly wooden
<personname> heard the sarcasm in his voice but he was not sure that anyone else did
he is feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment said <personname>
cos some son of a bludgers gone and nicked all mine and i says nicked all your toads will what next
but you know will nicked  them orf warty harris in the first place so i was not really doing nothing wrong  i do not know where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons said mrs <personname> coldly
knows all the crooks well he would seeing as he is one himself
<personname> who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking wary
how come <personname> gets his questions answered
you have not forgotten what <personname> said i suppose
but he is still  he is not a child said <personname> impatiently
<personname> back me up mr <personname> did not speak at once
he is got me yes said mrs <personname> her lip curling
he had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling <personname> was right he was not a child
if <personname>s allowed why cannot i
he added uncertainly meeting <personname>s eyes
<personname> took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing him for a month
what is he doing
you were not supposed to survive said <personname>
nobody apart from his death eaters was supposed to know he would come back
how has that helped
it is proving tricky though
<personname> came to power instead but he is never quite forgotten how much popular support <personname> had even though <personname> never applied for the job
but it seems that he is become fond of power now and much more confident
how can he think <personname> would just make it all up that i would make it all up
he is in charge of the hunt for <personname> so he is been feeding the ministry information that <personname> is in tibet
<personname> asked
they have demoted him from chief warlock on the wizengamot that is the wizard high court and they are talking about taking away his order of merlin first class too
asked <personname> desperately
<personname> asked swiftly
something he did not have last time
watch me snarled mrs <personname>
i will join i want to join i want to fight  no
it was not mrs <personname> who spoke this time but <personname>
if <personname>s not lying awake waiting for <personname> to tell her everything they said downstairs then i am a flobberworm all right <personname> <personname> said mrs <personname> on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom
<personname> does not want too many owls swooping around the square thinks it will look suspicious
<personname> and <personname> do
the only new bit was  crack
yeah size is no guarantee of power said george
said <personname>
shhh said <personname> half-rising from the bed
kreachers really old he probably could not manage you would be surprised what kreacher can manage when he wants to <personname> said <personname> who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats
i have just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to <personname>s inquiring look
<personname> picked it up and threw it in the bucket
<personname> was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb
if you eat the orange half of the puking pastilles you throw up
but they still need a bit of work
at the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end
he had forced the <personname> twins to take the thousand-galleon prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to mrs <personname> who did not think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons
stay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rats as mrs <personname>s screeches started up again from down below
she left the room closing the door carefully behind her
might be worth it said george
completely irresponsible as if we have not got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauld<personname>s into the house  the idiots are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head
it looked very old
a likely story said a voice behind <personname>
my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home kreachers quite fond of muttering the story under his breath
where did you go
your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as a second son
leave
because i hated the whole lot of them my parents with their pure-blood mania convinced that to be a <personname> made you practically royal  my idiot brother soft enough to believe them  that is him
he was younger than me said <personname> and a much better son as i was constantly reminded
but i bet my parents thought <personname> was a right little hero for joining up at first
the others moved over to her eager for some food but <personname> remained with <personname> who had bent closer to the tapestry
there is phineas nigellus  my great-great-grandfather see
i see <personname> is not on here
no andromedas not on here either look  he pointed to another small round burn mark between two names <personname> and <personname>
if you are only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited there are hardly any of us left
rodolphus s brother rabastan was with them too
he turned away from the tapestry his hands deep in his pockets
it was my fathers said <personname> throwing the ring into the sack
mrs <personname> kept them all working very hard over the next few days
<personname> went as far as to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do as master wishes before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher knows what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark <personname> yes with these mudbloods and traitors and scum at which <personname> ignoring <personname>s protests seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room
<personname> flitted in and out of the house several times more though to <personname>s relief they never came face-to-face he also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor <personname> looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat though she also seemed too busy to linger
as long as he was busy he was happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him
<personname> nodded and tried to keep eating his chops but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew
how am i getting there
when did <personname> tell you that
<personname> said staring at <personname>
the blank picture on the wall sniggered again
her hair was blonde and curly this morning
what do you want <personname>
<personname> nodded again
something very cold trickled down the back of <personname>s neck for a moment he thought someone was putting a disillusionment charm on him again then he realized that mrs <personname> was attacking his hair with a wet comb
mrs <personname> hugged him
yes but even so  said mr <personname> beaming fondly at them
let us see  six  he dialed the number two  four  and another four  and another two  as the dial whirred smoothly back into place a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box not from the receiver in mr <personname>s hand but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them
i am escorting a visitor said mr <personname> gesturing toward <personname>
wand grunted the security wizard at <personname> putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand
several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyones eye flattening his fringe as he did so
the doors closed the lift juddered upward again and the womans voice said level six department of magical transport incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test center
yes we are said mr <personname> those are enchanted windows magical maintenance decide what weather we are getting every day
we had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise just round here <personname>
i have been wanting a word with you have you got a second
and i am afraid you will have to wait for information on motorcycles we are extremely busy at the moment
a photograph of the <personname> family stood beside the in-tray
yes he is right i am sure <personname> will find that very amusing oh dear what is this now
anti-muggle pranksters said mr <personname> frowning
i have no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if you would missed it it would have been catastrophic mr <personname> skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button
his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor
court scribe <personname> ignatius <personname>   witness for the defense <personname> percival wulfric brian <personname> said a quiet voice from behind <personname> who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck
<personname> sat down put the tips of his long fingers together and looked at <personname> over them with an expression of polite interest
yes said <personname> because  a corporeal patronus
yes professor <personname> taught me in my third year because of the  impressive said madam bones staring down at him a true patronus at that age  very impressive indeed
some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their heads
it is not a question of how impressive the magic was said <personname> in a testy voice
he continued addressing the witch in the monocle
said <personname> loudly when mrs figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat
you will leave details of your parentage with my assistant <personname>
what is your story
what did they look like
they were big
and that  that was what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamely
mrs figg cast a frightened look from <personname> to <personname> then got up and shuffled off toward the door again
the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to
then said <personname> quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august
he thought she looked just like a large pale toad
so silly of me
of course it is not said <personname> mildly
nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on <personname>s right who was now gazing down at him instead of at <personname>
muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny but it is an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one mr <personname> broke off in mid-sentence
<personname> felt winded as though he had just walked into something heavy
no said mr <personname> curtly his fingers now biting into <personname>s shoulder
trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr <personname> looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard
<personname>s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people  then he can ask favors  delay laws he does not want passed  oh he is very well connected <personname> the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr <personname>s head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably
and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it
it is headquarters to the order of the phoenix is not it
you were so keen to help the order said mrs <personname> you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in
though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes whispered conversation mrs <personname> made sure that <personname> and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even <personname> seemed to feel that <personname> needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival
only two new ones he said reading the list
we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said <personname> conversationally
<personname> asked jumping down beside them
not surprising is it when you look at what is happened to the last four
<personname> looked around
well at least one of yous got their priorities right
the door banged open
it what
if you give them to me i will take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while you are packing
we have already bought him some said <personname> sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity
not a really good one <personname> hastened to add
or what
for some reason <personname> found that he did not want to look at <personname>
prefect
great
did this make him as arrogant as <personname>
was that true
listen <personname> well done mate
never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight <personname> ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face
we have not wanted to open it just in case it is something really nasty
no no i will do it myself later beamed mrs <personname>
said <personname> who was choosing a baked potato
when you think the comet two ninetys only naught to sixty and that is with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick
it is okay he told mundungus we can trust <personname> he is our financial backer
yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george
what
mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder
standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company <personname> caught the sound of his own name
said kingsley
it is what i would have done persisted kingsley  specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days <personname> did not look around he did not want <personname> or kingsley to know he had heard
all the air seemed to vanish from <personname>s lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy cold <personname> dead no it could not be but wait a moment it could not be <personname> was downstairs mrs <personname>
no mrs <personname> moaned
dead <personname>  mrs <personname> just get out of here shouted <personname> staring down at his own dead body on the floor
pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly  riddikulusv <personname>s body vanished
not even able to get rid of a boggart  do not be stupid said <personname> trying to smile
mrs <personname> smiled tremulously
<personname> ignored it
could have done her a serious injury you idiots  filthy half-breeds besmirching the house of my fathers  <personname> came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as <personname> was putting on his trainers <personname> was swaying on her shoulder and she was carrying a squirming crookshanks in her arms
we have to go to kings cross with a guard
<personname> and the dog followed her
she is waiting for us just up here said mrs <personname> stiffly averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside <personname>
mrs <personname> pursed her lips in an almost aunt <personname>-ish way
you too <personname>
quick quick said mrs <personname> distractedly hugging them at random and catching <personname> twice
<personname> and <personname> exchanged looks
she did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans
another remembrall
<personname> who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat but <personname> whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of trevor received a face full
<personname> whose face and torso were also drenched shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes
um  bad time
well  just thought i would say hello  bye then
look we can get rid of all this easily
and guess who is a slytherin prefect
i  must  not  look  like  a  baboons  backside everyone laughed but nobody laughed harder than <personname>
the headline on the article read <personname>  <personname> as he is painted
since when had <personname> been a singing sensation
but does he
what people do not realize is that <personname> is a false name  says mrs purkiss
he flicked back a few pages and found the piece on <personname>
you see i unlike you have been made a prefect which means that i unlike you have the power to hand out punishments
tell me how does it feel being second-best to <personname> <personname>
he had thought <personname> coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh but suddenly it seemed reckless if not downright dangerous <personname> had been right <personname> should not have come
rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more
she and <personname> pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests
i will carry that owl if you like said <personname> to <personname> reaching out for pigwidgeon as <personname> stowed trevor carefully in an inside pocket
he cannot have left <personname> told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd
he is just got a cold or something he looked around for <personname> or <personname> wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of professor grubbly-plank but neither of them was anywhere near him so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside hogsmeade station
here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle
said <personname>s voice right behind <personname>
i do not know said <personname> sounding worried
<personname> remained behind with <personname>
i was saying what are those horse things
see what
you are not going mad or anything
oh yes said <personname> i have been able to see them ever since my first day here
candles floated in midair all along the tables illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one another exchanging summer news shouting greetings at friends from other houses eyeing one anothers new haircuts and robes
he had more important things to worry about however he was looking over the students heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the hall
he is not there
<personname> and <personname> scanned the staff table too though there was no real need <personname>s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup
but where is he then
there was a pause then <personname> said very quietly so that <personname> parvati and <personname> could not hear maybe he is not back yet
she was at my hearing she works for <personname> nice cardigan said <personname> smirking
how could such friendships fail
why i was there and so can tell the whole sad sorry tale
yes indeed said nearly headless nick knowledgeably leaning across <personname> toward her <personname> winced it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you
between the absence of <personname> and the presence of those dragonish horses he had felt that his return to hogwarts so long anticipated was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song
to our newcomers said <personname> in a ringing voice his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips welcome to our old hands welcome back there is a time for speech making but this is not it
said nearly headless nick politely while <personname> looked revolted
fat chance
surely you have not still got
we have had two changes in staffing this year
thank you headmaster professor <personname> simpered for those kind words of welcome
i will be her friend as long as i do not have to borrow that cardigan parvati whispered to <personname> and both of them lapsed into silent giggles
the rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction
a balance then between old and new between permanence and change between tradition and innovation  <personname> found his attentiveness ebbing as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune
said <personname> blankly
well what does that mean
they did indeed seem very small <personname> was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here
a blond boy next to euan abercrombie looked petrified nudged euan and whispered something in his ear
he kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall then he hurried up the marble staircase took a couple of concealed shortcuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind
he had been stupid not to expect this he thought angrily as he walked through much emptier upstairs corridors
a fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands before going up to their dormitories on the other side of the room <personname> and <personname> were pinning something up on the notice board
hi he said moving across to his own trunk and opening it
hey <personname> said dean who was putting on a pair of pajamas in the west ham colors
yeah it was okay chuckled dean
said <personname> pausing in the act of pulling off his robes
what are you asking me for
do not talk to me like that i will talk to you how i want said <personname> his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table
oh  right
said <personname> heatedly casting <personname> a venomous look
you believe all the rubbish he is come out with about <personname> do you you reckon he is telling the truth
anyone who thought <personname> was a liar had to think that <personname> was too or else that <personname> had been hoodwinked they will know we are right in the end thought <personname> miserably as <personname> got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory
what is the matter
asked <personname> five minutes later catching up with <personname> and <personname> halfway across the common room as they all headed toward breakfast
it is up to us to stop this kind of thing <personname> said nothing <personname> could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping <personname> and george doing exactly what they liked was not one that he found inviting
you look really angry about something
<personname> whom <personname> had expected to react angrily on his behalf sighed
<personname> said loudly
asked <personname> looking at her in admiration
<personname> did not even mention how long that grubbly-plank womans staying he said as they made their way across to the gryffindor table
what dyou mean draw attention to it
said <personname> half laughing
hi angelina
<personname> and george sniggered
so you have got your exams coming up have not you
they will be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they will be rubbed raw said <personname> with satisfaction
tears and tantrums  patricia stimpson kept coming over faint kenneth towler came out in boils dyou remember
yep said <personname> unconcernedly
but we did not think mum could take us leaving school early not on top of <personname> turning out to be the worlds biggest prat
but where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop
his face felt hot he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it
cmon george if we get there early we might be able to sell a few extendable ears before herbology
i do not know said <personname>
an aurors worthwhile said <personname>
oh do not give me that rubbish said <personname> but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard
you do not support them do you
said <personname> in what <personname> considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice
even the ominous sound of <personname>s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest
he filed into the classroom behind <personname> and <personname> and followed them to their usual table at the back ignoring the huffy irritable noises now issuing from both of them
his eyes rested on <personname> and his lip curled
on <personname>s left <personname> sat up a little straighter her expression one of the utmost attentiveness
the ingredients and method <personname> flicked his wand are on the blackboard they appeared there you will find everything you need he flicked his wand again in the store cupboard the door of the said cupboard sprang open you have an hour and a half start
the surface of <personname>s potion however was a shimmering mist of silver vapor and as <personname> swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment which meant that he could find nothing to criticize
the draught of peace said <personname> tensely
no said <personname> very quietly
no said <personname> more loudly
when at long last the bell rang <personname> was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time <personname> and <personname> joined him in the great hall
he said
then divide into pairs
you say one
probably that you are going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something said <personname> turning the pages of the dream oracle without interest
she rapped the blackboard again the first message vanished and was replaced by course aims 1
so has everyone got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard
if you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class
we are not going to use magic
no but  well then i am afraid you are not qualified to decide what the svhole point of any class is
said dean thomas hotly
as long as you have studied the theory hard enough there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions said professor <personname> dismissively
said parvati incredulously
inquired professor <personname> in a horribly honeyed voice
<personname> gasped <personname> uttered a little scream <personname> slipped sideways off his stool
now let me make a few things quite plain
<personname> asked his voice shaking
<personname>s death was a tragic accident she said coldly
he could feel himself shaking
<personname> killed him and you know it
speaking in peeves blew a gigantic raspberry tongues
come in here <personname>
he followed her inside her study
said professor <personname> rounding on him
yes said <personname>
misbehavior in <personname> <personname>s class could cost you much more than house points and a detention
professor <personname> eyed him for a moment then sniffed walked around her desk and held open the door for him
it is just that before the truth could sink in everyone went home for the summer where they spent two months reading about how you are a nutcase and <personname>s going senile rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to gryffindor tower
crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them purring loudly and when <personname> <personname> and <personname> took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly into <personname> s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion
yes but to employ someone who is actually refusing to let us do magic what is <personname> playing at
most of the people watching were laughing <personname> however squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where <personname> and george now stood with clipboards closely observing the unconscious first years
i do not care it could be dangerous rubbish said <personname>
you cannot do this what if you made one of them really ill
said <personname> slowly
<personname> shook his head noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse
she looked mildly pleased about something and when <personname> asked her what she had to be so happy about she simply said the hats have gone
seems the house-elves do want freedom after all
you cannot pass an owl said professor <personname> grimly without serious application practice and study
let us crack on then who can tell me what these things are called
good girl take another five points
the class surged forward around the trestle table
i was not going to said <personname> calmly
a few seconds later <personname> emerged trailing behind the rest of the class a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head
you can laugh <personname> said her voice rising apparently under the impression that parvati and <personname> were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing
oh for heavens sake <personname> you can do better than her said <personname>
less than zero said <personname> glumly tipping lamb chops onto his plate and starting to eat
he had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her
professor <personname>
her bulging eyes narrowed
off you go
yes
he knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any not even if he had to sit here all night cutting open his own hand with this quill come here she said after what seemed hours
<personname> repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings
<personname> who had been fast asleep when <personname> got back to the dormitory muttered something about doing other stuff bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words
i am in detention <personname> yelled after her as she stalked away
the pause in the pointed quills scratching made professor <personname> look up
there
i am not bad said <personname> who looked immensely relieved at <personname>s reaction
he is got enough on his mind said <personname> but that was not the true reason
though <personname> glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered the great hall it was without real hope of seeing <personname> and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with <personname>
two things sustained <personname> that day
was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead
<personname> pressed a bottle onto him
it was a few moments before <personname> noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds
i am banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today to be honest
but i do not think he can be possessing her the way he possessed quirrell i mean he is properly alive again now is not he he is got his own body he would not need to share someone elses
er  no i do not think i will thanks he said
the only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow deep breathing of his fellow gryffindors
wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not <personname> uncorked his ink bottle dipped his quill into it and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment thinking hard but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate at a complete loss for what to say
i am not doing anything wrong <personname> called after her
the treetops of the forbidden forest swayed in a light breeze
the owlery door opened behind him
right said <personname>
the tornado-hater
putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how how how he died
you were really brave standing up to her like that
feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter <personname> said i cannot it is gone
at the entrance of a corridor that led toward the west wing of the castle <personname> said i am going this way
the other two looked at him
the ministry suspects he is one of <personname>s lot so i do not know they lured him to the ministry and he was not trying to get through a door at all maybe they have just made something up to get him there was a pause while <personname> and <personname> considered this
all their teammates but angelina were already in the changing room when they entered
they fitted him well considering they had been oliver woods who was rather broader in the shoulder
<personname> <personname> and pansy parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter
<personname> and the rest of the slytherin team were howling with laughter
we are going to aim for <personname>s goal obviously
he was fine when i was practicing with him this morning
yeah well i hope he has not peaked too soon said <personname> gloomily
it was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the seekers team and doing so required enormous speed and skill
oh  sorry  you keep shifting around while you are watching the chasers said angelina
and so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker slowly the crowd in the common room began to thin again
is not that hermes
<personname> unrolled the scroll and began to read
as you must be aware given that our father escorted him to court <personname> had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good
your loyalty <personname> should be not to him but to the school and the ministry
please think over what i have said most carefully particularly the bit about <personname> and congratulations again on becoming prefect
he threw the pieces into the fire
oh give them here she said abruptly
thanks a million <personname> said <personname> weakly passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair rubbing his eyes
it was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and crookshanks
because i have just seen <personname>s head in the fire said <personname>
what about
apparently she loathes part-humans she campaigned to have mer-people rounded up and tagged last year too
yep said <personname>
you are less like your father than i thought he said finally a definite coolness in his voice
there was a tiny pop and the place where <personname>s head had been was flickering flame once more
wait there is more said <personname> grimly
i think the appointment of the inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence said a ministry insider last night
wizengamot elders gris elda m archbanks and tiberius ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of inquisitor to hogwarts
<personname> will not know what is hit her
i have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your o
this should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination
and i have always thought <personname> and i should have got e in everything because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams
you know what flitwicks like he treated her like a guest did not seem to bother him at all
but <personname> did not have to wait for defense against the dark arts to meet professor <personname>
the class which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once
another note on the clipboard
professor trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears
all the while professor <personname> stood a few feet away making notes on that clipboard and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their defense against the dark arts lesson ten minutes later
as we finished chapter one last lesson i would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two common defensive theories and their derivation
yes i do said <personname> who unlike <personname> was not whispering but speaking in a clear carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the classs attention
but i think they can be very useful when they are used defensively
said <personname> angrily
detention
from whom
<personname> you must get a grip on yourself you are heading for serious trouble another five points from gryffindor but what
<personname> however merely rustled the pages of her daily prophet and said nothing
i wish she had not taken points from you but i think she is right to warn you not to lose your temper with <personname> said <personname>s voice while <personname> gesticulated forcefully from the front page clearly giving some kind of speech
she did however take many more notes while she sat in her corner and when professor <personname> finally told them all to pack away rose with a grim expression on her face
professor <personname> asked
thirty-nine years this december said professor <personname> brusquely snapping her bag shut
when they walked down the lawns toward the forest for care of magical creatures they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside professor grubbly-plank
that was me he said
crookshanks curled around his legs purring loudly and then leapt into his lap and settled down
thanks he said gratefully scratching behind crookshanks s ears with his left hand
she is an awful woman said <personname> in a small voice
awful
i suggested poison said <personname> grimly
i know what went on all right
you think it is just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him like you are in class or something
they flew back together good as new but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl
and
he looked up at <personname>
yes <personname> said <personname> gently but all the same there is no point pretending that you are not good at defense against the dark arts because you are
ho ho said <personname> in a bored voice
do not worry <personname> <personname> said quietly
however <personname> who was taking more subjects than either of them had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes
i suppose he was checking for the smell of dungbombs said <personname> with a small laugh
where are we going anyway
the three broomsticks
oh no said <personname> coming out of her reverie no it is always packed and really noisy
i think it is a bit  you know  dodgy  but students do not normally go in there so i do not think we will be overheard
two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows <personname> might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong yorkshire accents in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick black veil that fell to her toes
he was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch
and i have looked up everything i can think of about study groups and homework groups and they are definitely allowed
then he turned away and deposited <personname>s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it
hi <personname> said <personname> beaming and taking a seat opposite <personname>
when everybody had pulled up a chair the chatter died out
he did not take his eyes from zacharias smiths aggressive face determined not to look at <personname>
er you do not know madam bones do you
blimey <personname> said lee looking deeply impressed
she is not wrong mumbled <personname> and a couple of people laughed
that is what one of the portraits on the wall told me when i was in there last year er yeah i did yeah said <personname>
and nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer said susan bones
i really do not think there is any point in meeting less than once a week  hang on said angelina we need to make sure this does not clash with our quidditch practice
no said <personname> nor with ours
after all <personname> has got his own private army
snapped <personname>
maybe an unused classroom
i well we are prefects ernie burst out
said <personname> testily
i yes of course i will sign
nobody raised objections after ernie though <personname> saw <personname>s friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name
it was as though they had just signed some kind of contract
<personname> used to fancy <personname> but she gave up on him months ago
so do not harp on about it for heavens sake
i am not going to harp on about anything  <personname> continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street
an organization society team group or club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students
his insides were pulsing with rage
this is not a coincidence he said his hands forming fists
he bounded forward pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase
er i do not think we are allowed in the girls dormitories said <personname> pulling <personname> to his feet and trying not to laugh
two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide
it is not fair he added to <personname> as the girls headed off for the portrait hole still giggling madly
later we will talk to you lateri i will tell michael said <personname> impatiently swinging herself off her bench
do not worry i will behave myself bet <personname> is in history of magic said <personname> grimly as they set off for binnss lesson
she has not inspected binns yet bet you anything she is there but he was wrong the only teacher present when they entered was professor binns floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars
professor binns said <personname> loudly and everyone in the class turned to look at him
yes  yes hospital wing  well off you go then perkins  once outside the room <personname> returned <personname> to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor pausing to think only when he was out of sight of binnss door
he peered out of a window at the blustery overcast grounds
no professor said <personname> hastily
well then why are you out of class
no problem said professor grubbly-plank gruffly turning back into the staffroom
to grubbly-plank said <personname>
i just hope nobody else has read this but it was still sealed and everything said <personname> trying to convince himself as much as her
i do not know said <personname> anxiously hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again
inside all of you
<personname> and <personname> would have torn you apart
what in the name of merlin said <personname> slowly as they followed <personname> was that about
he knew exactly why the subject of people who were in st
obviously
i suppose this is relevant
professor trelawney was handing out copies of the dream oracle yet again he would surely be much better employed doing <personname>s punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams
professor trelawney slammed a copy of the oracle down on the table between <personname> and <personname> and swept away her lips pursed she threw the next copy of the oracle at <personname> and dean narrowly avoiding <personname>s head and thrust the final one into <personname>s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf
wrong cried professor trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion
i say nothing she choked of sixteen years devoted service it has passed apparently unnoticed but i shall not be insulted no i shall not but professor who is insulting you
asked parvati timidly
<personname> shot him a disgusted look
professor said parvati do you mean  is it something professor <personname>
<personname> who was making very little progress with his potions essay decided to give it up for the night
as he put his books away <personname> who was dozing lightly in an armchair gave a muffled grunt awoke looked blearily into the fire and said <personname> <personname> whipped around <personname>s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again
the ministrys forced through another decree which means we are not allowed to have quidditch teams   or secret defense against the dark arts groups
said <personname>
we lost <personname>s spare invisibility cloak when sturgis was arrested so dungs been dressing as a witch a lot lately anyway  first of all <personname> i have sworn to pass on a message from your mother
she says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now
said <personname> his heart lifting
well that is a bit of a problem now said <personname>
i have been suspecting this ever since <personname> accused you of ordering dungbombs because it seemed such a stupid lie <personname> whispered
i do not reckon he will risk it again said <personname>
now let me see you try mr <personname> wha
they were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside
<personname> and <personname> looked at each other
what said <personname> and <personname> together
he is always given us great advice an ink pellet whizzed past them striking katie bell squarely in the ear
if only i had not offered to sell her some puking pastilles yesterday  we could try the fever <personname> george muttered no ones seen that yet  does it work
<personname> could hear them complaining in low voices as he toweled his hair dry
what happened
but  looking scared <personname> strode across to the window and stared out into the rain he he cannot be near us now can he
you have got to tell someone said <personname>
<personname> shrugged
cmon  we have still got silencing charms to practice they hurried back through the dark grounds sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns not talking
he had not thought about those words in weeks he had been too absorbed in what was going on at hogwarts too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with <personname> the injustice of all the ministry interference but now they came back to him and made him wonder <personname>s anger would make sense if he was no nearer laying hands on the weapon whatever it was had the order thwarted him stopped him from seizing it
it appeared that <personname> had gone to bed early leaving crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire
midnight came and went while <personname> was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it these plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draughts where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness  <personname> said <personname> was becoming reckless cooped up in grimmauld place  moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used   the daily prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that he knew what <personname> was feeling   therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draughts   confusing was the word all right why did he know what <personname> was feeling
said <personname> thickly peering through the gloom toward the source of the voice
<personname> volunteered to return <personname>s owl said the elf squeakily with a look of positive adoration on his face
yeah how is winky
none of them will clean gryffindor tower anymore not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere they finds them insulting sir
<personname> does it all himself sir but <personname> does not mind sir for he always hopes to meet <personname> and tonight sir he has got his wish <personname> sank into a deep bow again
he would have to try and finish the essay tomorrow
<personname> knows the perfect place sir he said happily
it sounds brilliant said <personname> his heart racing
it was after all very late he was exhausted and had <personname>s essay to finish
when he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice he found <personname> watching him
okay said <personname> quietly while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch
the walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor
and just look at these books said <personname> excitedly running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes
this is the place we have found for practices and you have er obviously found it okay  it is fantastic said <personname> and several people murmured their agreement
but it was just a broom cupboard then hey <personname> what is this stuff
it would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity do not you think
the da for short so nobody knows what we are talking about
i was thinking the first thing we should do is expelliarmus you know the disarming charm
i do not think expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against <personname> do you
okay stop <personname> shouted
stop stop
she does not really want to be here but i made her come with me
well they have forbidden me to get on the wrong side of <personname> too said <personname> drawing herself up proudly
well that was pretty good said <personname> but we have overrun we would better leave it here
same time same place next week
he and the da were resisting her under her very nose doing the very thing that she and the ministry most feared and whenever he was supposed to be reading wilbert slinkhards book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings remembering how <personname> had successfully disarmed <personname> how colin creevey had mastered the impediment jinx after three meetings hard effort how parvati patil had produced such a good reductor curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the sneakoscopes to dust
oh  well  yes i suppose it is how come you are not in ravenclaw
you know what these remind me of
no what is that
that is where i got the idea  but you will notice i decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members skin yeah  i prefer your way said <personname> grinning as he slipped his galleon into his pocket
the fact that the quidditch cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game
the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome for they of course would be playing both teams over the coming year and the heads of house of the competing teams though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship were determined to see their sides victory
nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at <personname> and <personname> and said grimly i have become accustomed to seeing the quidditch cup in my study boys and i really do not want to have to hand it over to professor <personname> so use the extra time to practice will not you
<personname> felt optimistic about gryffindors chances they had after all never lost to <personname>s team
<personname> of course had endured their snide comments for more than four years so whispers of hey potty i heard warringtons sworn to knock you off your broom on saturday far from chilling his blood made him laugh
you all right
as they passed the slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise <personname> looked around and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing in addition to the usual green-and-silver scarves and hats silver badges in the shape of what seemed to be crowns
i must have been mental to do this he said in a croaky whisper
i am lousy
look at that save you made with your foot the other day even <personname> and george said it was brilliant  <personname> turned a tortured face to <personname>
i did not mean to do it i slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and i was trying to get back on and i kicked the quaffle by accident
look what it does she reached up and tapped the hat with her wand
it became clear after ten minutes however that <personname> was not capable of eating anything more and <personname> thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms
<personname> looked questioningly at her but she shook her head warningly <personname> had just ambled over to them looking lost and desperate
they could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators stands now
mount your brooms madam hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew
<personname> pulled his firebolt around he and <personname> were now neck and neck  feet from the ground <personname> lifted his right hand from his broom stretching toward the snitch  to his right <personname>s arm extended too reaching groping  it was over in two breathless desperate windswept seconds <personname>s fingers closed around the tiny struggling ball <personname>s fingernails scrabbled the back of <personname>s hand hopelessly <personname> pulled his broom upward holding the struggling ball in his hand and the gryffindor spectators screamed their approval they were saved it did not matter that <personname> had let in those goals nobody would remember as long as gryffindor had won wham a bludger hit <personname> squarely in the small of the back and he flew forward off his broom luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground having dived so low to catch the snitch but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch
said <personname> sneering
bellowed professor <personname>
<personname> felt the snitch fluttering madly in his hand
from playing  ever again
i am going to bed said angelina getting slowly to her feet
but at that precise moment there was a creaking sound behind them as the fat lady swung forward and <personname> came clambering through the portrait hole
when he saw <personname> and <personname> he stopped dead in his tracks
you look frozen said <personname>
said <personname>
what
<personname> it is us <personname> called through the keyhole
it was obvious that he had only just got home a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door
<personname> himself twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it
fer the las time it is nuthin said <personname> firmly
would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face
top secret
but his beard twitched
so you have been to look for giants
growled <personname>
<personname> asked him wide-eyed
i was on a secret mission wasn i didn wan owls followin me all over the place ruddy dementors you are not serious
oh <personname> do not it is not hygien  <personname> began but <personname> had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye
he took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said well we set off righ after term ended  madame <personname> went with you then
you knew where the giants were
are they hidden
but where they ares very difficult ter get ter fer humans anyway so we needed <personname>s instructions
we are bein watched <personname> he said gruffly
what dyou mean
but we managed ter give the berk tailin us the slip round abou dee-john  ooooh dijon
i have been there on holiday did you see
ran inter a couple of mad trolls on the polish border an i had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in minsk but apart from tha could nota bin smoother
so said <personname> you saw them and then what
how could you tell which one was the gurg
name of karkus
asked <personname> incredulously
and did he like the present
we were hopeful when we left that day
the men fight each other an the women fight each other the remnants of the old tribes fight each other an that is even without squabbles over food an the best fires an sleepin spots
after you would watched him rip off another giants head
course we did said <personname> we hadn gone all that way ter give up after two days we wen down with the next present we would meant ter give ter karkus
we didn leave after three days said <personname> looking outraged
what dyou mean
death eaters
bloke they sent ter kill buckbeak
hold yer hippogriffs i haven finished me story yet said <personname> indignantly who considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place now seemed to be rather enjoying himself
how could you tell which ones they were
so what happened
did you ever get near any of the other giants
oh  oh yeah we did
<personname> looked at her sadly
golgomaths lot raided the caves
did you  was there any sign of  did you hear anything about your  your  mother while you were there
but you still have not explained how you got in this state <personname> <personname> said gesturing toward <personname>s bloodstained face
i but the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door
<personname> gasped her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor fang yelped
<personname> said sounding thoroughly confused
she bent and peered under the bed
another teacher has had to cover your classes
you are inspectin us
she might not be gone yet
yeah said <personname> pulling the cloak off
but thas not very interestin <personname> said <personname>
<personname> is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to <personname>
please <personname> teach us something dull that is bound to come up in our owl
said <personname> looking up when she entered
got all his lessons planned for him
he was not even there when i arrived i was knocking for at least half an hour
and then he came stumping out of the forest <personname> groaned
no said <personname> miserably
he says he wants them to be a surprise
he still will not say how he got all those injuries <personname>s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students
some like <personname> george and lee roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables to wring <personname>s enormous hand others like parvati and <personname> exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads
as though to complete the ominous picture <personname> was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder
bit more sheltered anyway they prefer the dark what prefers the dark
<personname> heard <personname> say sharply to <personname> and <personname> a trace of panic in his voice
now what we are studyin today is pretty rare i reckon i am probably the ony person in britain who is managed ter train  them  and you are sure they are trained are you
demanded <personname>
they walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow on the ground at all
a pair of blank white shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face neck and then skeletal body of a great black winged horse emerged from the darkness
most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as <personname>s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them
hogwarts has got a whole herd of  them in here
but they are really really unlucky interrupted parvati looking alarmed
telling you that i would be inspecting your lesson
no come on said <personname> looking a little anxious now
i am going to walk she mimed walking <personname> and pansy parkinson were having silent fits of laughter among the students she pointed around at individual members of the class and ask them questions
just like <personname> pansy had tears in her eyes but these were tears of laughter indeed her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles
no  because  well  it sounds  like grunting a lot of the time <personname> scribbled on her clipboard
ignore them just ignore them intoned <personname> pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses
in any case he did not want to think about christmas
<personname> arrived early in the room of requirement for the last da meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had because when the lamps burst into light he saw that <personname> had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for christmas
he jumped out from under it
it is often infested with nargles
we can practice in pairs said <personname>
when he passed <personname> she beamed at him he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times
the room began to clear in the usual twos and threes most people wished <personname> a happy christmas as they went
i suppose  it is just  learning all this stuff it just makes me  wonder whether  if he would known it all  he would still be alive <personname>s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel
he was really good at it or he could never have got to the middle of that maze
oh do not go said <personname> sounding tearful again
he would have been so pleased just with a merry christmas i know it must be horrible for you she said mopping her eyes on her sleeve again
his mouth was very dry
what are nargles
<personname> i mean
a reluctant grin spread over <personname>s face as he watched <personname> rolling around on the hearthrug
she does it at mealtimes in the loos all over the place
no said <personname> and <personname> together
maybe next time  if there was a next time  she would be a bit happier
<personname> was accusing him of luring her there under false pretenses she said that he had promised her a hundred and fifty <personname>colate frog cards if she showed up
he is really ill said a scared voice
whether one minute passed or ten <personname> did not know he simply sat there shaking feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard <personname>s voice again
the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator
professor <personname> rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off
professor <personname> looked around at <personname> frowning slightly
but <personname> stood up so quickly that <personname> jumped and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling
everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people  both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures as usually happened at hogwarts neither reappeared one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair
everard and dilys were two of hogwarts s most celebrated heads <personname> said now sweeping around <personname> <personname> and professor <personname> and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door
as they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere but mr <personname> could be anywhere said <personname>
naturally naturally murmured <personname> apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise
anyway they carried him up a few minutes later
<personname> i need you to go and wake the other <personname> children
he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully upon his desk
do you understand
mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries
floo powder
she must know you are out of your beds <personname> go and head her off tell her any story  professor <personname> was gone in a swish of tartan
and quickly before anyone else joins us <personname> and the others gathered around <personname>s desk
he said stretching out a hand to help <personname> up
the twins glared at <personname> for another minute then took seats on either side of <personname>
his stomach was full of horrible hot bubbling guilt
that is not <personname>s writing it must be a message from your mother here  he thrust the letter into georges hand who ripped it open and read aloud  dad is still alive
<personname> pulled the parchment out of georges hands and read it for himself then looked up at <personname> who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling
so it is breakfast for let us see seven  bacon and eggs i think and some tea and toast  <personname> hurried over to the stove to help
<personname> said that he was very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him as long as mr <personname> was in hospital
can i have a quick word
er now
when he paused for breath <personname> said did you tell <personname> this
but that is not all said <personname> in a voice only a little above a whisper
their trunks arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch so that they could dress as muggles for the trip to st
in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here
the place had a shabby miserable air the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew standing at random and modeling fashions at least ten years out of date
are they doctors
said <personname> looking startled
<personname> will not want too many visitors at once it ought to be just the family first
<personname> drew back too but mrs <personname> reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying do not be silly <personname> <personname> wants to thank you the ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door
he looked around as they walked toward him and seeing whom it was beamed
asked george
well you already know do not you
he snatched up the daily prophet shook it open again and said i was just reading about willy widdershinss arrest when you arrived
i can only suppose gold changed hands  you were guarding it were not you
and he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost
you saw it the night he returned did not you
<personname> and <personname> are outside <personname> they want to come and see you
you can come and say good-bye afterward
go on they trooped back into the corridor
okay go <personname> whispered
for a few seconds <personname> could hear nothing then he heard <personname> whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him
course he is worried growled <personname>
said mrs <personname> in a worried voice as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of grimmauld place
you go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours sleep before dinner all right
he nodded here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others which was precisely what he wanted so when she opened the front door he proceeded straight past the trolls leg umbrella stand and up the stairs and hurried into his and <personname>s bedroom
phineas nigellus had appeared upon the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame watching <personname> with an amused expression on his face
this is no cowardly flight you are being noble
<personname> ignored him
<personname>s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass
that is all anyone could tell me after i got attacked by those dementors too just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out <personname> we will not bother telling you anything though because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it you know said phineas nigellus even more loudly than <personname> this is precisely why i loathed being a teacher young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything
no like all young people you are quite sure that you alone feel and think you alone recognize danger you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the dark <personname> may be planning he is planning something to do with me then
when he heard mrs <personname> calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her
<personname> told me what had happened first thing this morning but i had to wait for term to end officially before setting off
<personname> is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose even though <personname> told her mr <personname> was in st
lucky you said <personname> coolly
are there big blank periods where you do not know what you have been up to
his heart swelled with happiness and relief and he felt like joining in as they heard <personname> tramping past their door toward buckbeaks room singing god rest ye merry hippogriffs at the top of his voice
do not go downstairs for a bit
has not asked how dad is or visited him or anything we tried to comfort her said <personname> moving around the bed to look at <personname>s portrait
best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast i reckon
asked <personname> squinting at <personname>s painting
says so on the back good likeness said <personname> grinning
i have been wanting that new theory of numerology for ages and that perfume is really unusual <personname>
who is that for anyway
no it is a patchwork quilt i thought it would brighten up his bedroom
what bedroom
apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen
mrs <personname> was the only person in the basement when they arrived there
mundungus turned up in time for christmas pudding and trifle having managed to borrow a car for the occasion as the underground did not run on christmas day
the car which <personname> doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of its owner had had a similar enlarging spell put upon it as the <personname>s old ford anglia although normally proportioned outside ten people with mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably
nothing nothing said mr <personname> airily starting to unwrap his pile of gifts
<personname> strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around mr <personname> <personname> muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and <personname> and george leapt up to accompany him grinning
a man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass
he had wavy blond hair bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth
has not changed much has he
let us not stay long <personname> said quietly
the moment he had been deposited in his chair by the healer gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs toward him seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly
here you are agnes said the healer brightly to the furry-faced woman handing her a small pile of christmas presents
<personname>s head spun round
yes <personname>s told me all about you
he is a good boy she said casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at <personname> but he has not got his fathers talent i am afraid to say and she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly
they did not give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them you know i am not ashamed said <personname> very faintly still looking anywhere but at <personname> and the others
<personname> and <personname> both clapped their hands over their mouths
<personname>s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress
her face was thin and worn now her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair which had turned white was wispy and dead-looking
i never knew said <personname> who looked tearful
nor did i said <personname> rather hoarsely
<personname> told me but i promised i would not mention it  that is what <personname> got sent to azkaban for using the cruciatus curse on <personname>s parents until they lost their minds
look i did not learn joined-up writing for nothing you know occlumency kreacher it transpired had been lurking in the attic
<personname> did not mention his vague suspicions to <personname> whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that christmas was over
i was supposed to see you alone <personname> said <personname> the familiar sneer curling his mouth but <personname>  i am his godfather said <personname> louder than ever
merely that i am sure you must feel ah frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful <personname> laid a delicate stress on the word for the order
you will receive private lessons once a week but you will not tell anybody what you are doing least of all <personname> <personname>
who is going to be teaching me
i am he said
he looked quickly around at <personname> for support
nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them
why yes i suppose i am said <personname>
<personname> pocketed his wand and swept back across the kitchen passing the <personname>s without comment
okay said <personname> stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket but he knew he would never use whatever it was
the door of number twelve slammed shut behind them
on on get on and she shoved <personname> forward toward the steps past the conductor who goggled at <personname> as he passed
just outside birmingham said stan happily answering <personname>s unasked question as <personname> struggled up from the floor
the knight bus swayed alarmingly overtaking a line of cars on the inside
looking toward the front of the bus <personname> saw <personname> cover her eyes with her hands pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder
he turned around and found <personname> standing there
oh said <personname> as his stomach leapt uncomfortably
mine was pretty quiet said <personname>
right  well  that is settled then said <personname> and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all he headed off to the library to pick up <personname> and <personname> before their afternoon lessons walking in a rather bouncy way himself
shut the door behind you <personname>
when he turned back to face the room <personname> had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk
it is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another persons mind  he can read minds
well then why do i have to learn occlumency
<personname> eyed <personname> tracing his mouth with one long thin finger as he did so
the usual rules do not seem to apply with you <personname>
there was a nasty silence
i told you said <personname> rigid in his chair his eyes slits to call me sir
asked <personname>
which brings us back to occlumency
repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand
he pushed himself up again to find <personname> staring at him his wand raised
i saw i remembered <personname> panted
because said <personname> watching <personname> closely for a reaction that corridor i have just seen i have been dreaming about it for months i have just recognized it it leads to the department of mysteries  and i think <personname> wants something from  i have told you not to say the dark <personname>s name they glared at each other
yes <personname> said still rubbing his prickling scar which was becoming more painful
he picked up his schoolbag swung it over his shoulder and hurried toward the office door
when he sat down opposite <personname> and <personname> he caught sight of himself in the window opposite
yeah  fine  i do not know said <personname> impatiently wincing as pain shot through his scar again
has your dad ever mentioned anything about it
he was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack mr <personname> and felt very sick
the words came just as they had back in the gryffindor changing room as though a stranger was speaking them through <personname>s mouth yet he knew they were true
<personname> told me to come and check on you said <personname> in a low voice helping <personname> to his feet
when <personname>s daily prophet arrived she smoothed it out gazed for a moment at the front page and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her
she had long dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture though he had seen it sleek thick and shining
i mean he is spent a good six months telling everyone you and <personname> are liars has not he
how come we did not recognize devils snare
said <personname> sharply
all righ you two
you are on probation
said <personname> very loudly so that many students passing looked around curiously
sno moren i expected ter tell you the truth
bes go an mb a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tailsll be hangin off  them next
as for the freakish death of an obscure department of mysteries employee in st
not with <personname> there
maybe it is a bit like an illness said <personname> looking concerned when <personname> confided in her and <personname>
what do you mean
this is really important do you think you could meet me in the three broomsticks around midday
like it is going to help we are the worst team i have ever seen
you should see sloper and kirke they are pathetic even worse than i am
<personname> and <personname> screeched pansy to a chorus of snide giggles
it is funny is not it said <personname> in a low voice also gazing up at the pictures of the death eaters
remember when that <personname> escaped and there were dementors all over hogsmeade looking for him
the ten escaped death eaters were staring out of every shop window he and <personname> passed
said <personname> happily
perhaps <personname> would expect him to hold her hand
she was now watching roger davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression
a couple of weeks ago
roger
well no  he said quietly
every eye was upon <personname>
he threw a galleon down onto the table shook pink confetti out of his eyes and followed <personname> out of the door
why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe
he shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around
makes a differentrence having a decent family he said
whatever you say bloods important and he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye
but before <personname> could think about the matter any further he heard a voice calling his name
and then beneath a nice big photograph of you disturbed teenage survivor of <personname>s attack <personname> 1 5 caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being death eaters  the quick-quotes quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face
everyone thinks he is delusional
said <personname> scathingly
he does not care about making money
she said witheringly
<personname> stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great whoop of laughter
the quibbleii she said cackling
i do not suppose i have got any choice have i
she opened her crocodile bag once more withdrew a piece of parchment and raised her quick-quotes quill
i suppose said <personname> watching <personname> balancing the quick-quotes quill at the ready on the parchment between them
and of course that will be a very important story so <personname>s might have to wait for the following issue said <personname>
he guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about crumple-horned snorkacks
he was rather pale but went on in a low voice it must have been  tough  talking about it was it
<personname> glanced over at the back of <personname>s head and sighed
you should have told her differently said <personname> still with that maddeningly patient air
you should have said it was really annoying but i would made you promise to come along to the three broomsticks and you really did not want to go you would much rather spend the whole day with her but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please please come along with you and hopefully you would be able to get away more quickly
but i do not think you are ugly said <personname> bemused
actually i do not know how she got so good seeing how we never let her play with us she is been breaking into your broom she would in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you were not looking said <personname> from behind her tottering pile of ancient rune books
kill him more like said <personname> firmly
the very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short the gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony
anyway once you are back on the team  <personname> i have got a lifelong ban
anyway once you are back i think i will try out for chaser
she says she knows he is got it in him
<personname> had left the pitch to another booming chorus of <personname> is our king sung with great gusto by the slytherins who were now favorites to win the quidditch cup
the memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark

but when he left the room he found himself facing not the tapestry of barnabas the barmy but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall
i expect all these she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of <personname> are letters from readers
help yourself said <personname> feeling slightly bemused
<personname> looked up with his hands full of envelopes
she asked slowly
is that a crime now
here  and he threw the copy of the quibbler at her
by mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school not just on house notice boards but in the corridors and classrooms too
the above is in accordance with educational decree number twenty-seven
<personname> knew she was looking for copies of the quibbler but the students were several steps ahead of her
dads reprinting she told <personname> her eyes popping excitedly
<personname> did not find this very amusing she said it interfered with her concentration and ended up going to bed early out of irritation
he also felt slightly sick
he seemed to be trembling
for a few seconds he did not know where he was he was convinced that he was about to see the white skull-like face looming at him out of the dark again then <personname>s voice spoke very near to him
has someone been attacked again
remove something he said bode would have known he could not have done it bode was under the imperius curse i think he said <personname>s dad put it on him bode was bewitched to remove something
i would not have seen it at all if i could do occlumency
he was recovering
arrested for trying to get through a door
rookwood used to work there maybe <personname> will send rookwood to do it
but  well i think we should just try and forget what you saw said <personname> firmly
that last memory said <personname>
said <personname> in a low dangerous voice
one two three legilimensv a hundred dementors were swooping toward <personname> across the lake in the grounds he screwed up his face in concentration they were coming closer he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods  yet he could also see <personname> standing in front of him his eyes fixed upon <personname>s face muttering under his breath and somehow <personname> was growing clearer and the dementors were growing fainter  <personname> raised his own wand
protegol <personname> staggered his wand flew upward away from <personname> and suddenly <personname>s mind was teeming with memories that were not his a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner a greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom pointing his wand at the ceiling shooting down flies a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick enough <personname> felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest he took several staggering steps backward hit some of the shelves covering <personname>s walls and heard something crack
said <personname>
<personname> <personname> opened his eyes
he was flat on his back again with no memory of having gotten there he was also panting as though he really had run the length of the department of mysteries corridor really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room explain yourself said <personname> who was standing over him looking furious
<personname>s head jerked upward he was gazing at the ceiling
there there sibyll  calm down blow your nose on this it is not as bad as you think now you are not going to have to leave hogwarts oh really professor <personname>
said <personname> with a singularly unpleasant little laugh
i am afraid you do not understand the position
i have here she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes an order of dismissal signed by myself and the minister of magic
of course said <personname>
professor <personname> was standing stock-still staring at <personname> who continued to smile benignly
you see i have already found us a new divination teacher and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor
you have found
through the mist came a face <personname> had seen once before on a dark dangerous night in the forbidden forest white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse
i think you 11 find him suitable
anyway i thought you two were all upset that trelawney had gone
you saw the look on her face when she saw firenze after breakfast <personname> departed for her arithmancy class and <personname> and <personname> followed parvati and <personname> into the entrance hall heading for divination
the students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests looking rather nervous
er hi said <personname> shaking hands with the centaur who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile
as he turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor he saw that they were all looking at him with awe apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with firenze whom they seemed to find intimidating
he is not very definite on anything is he
the centaur advanced a little toward him
you may stay firenze told him
he would do better to abandon it
firenze looked at <personname> impassively
the attemps cornin on fine
look ah it is gone but it was definitely something hairy <personname> <personname>s patronus a shining silver otter was gamboling around her
next thing he knew something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee
for the elfs eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking
<personname> sir  squeaked the elf trembling from head to foot <personname> sir  <personname> has come to warn you  but the house-elves have been warned not to tell  he ran headfirst at the wall <personname> who had some experience of <personname>s habits of self-punishment made to seize him but <personname> merely bounced off the stone cushioned by his eight hats
<personname> bellowed
<personname> glanced left and right the others were all moving so fast that he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished
he rolled over onto his back and saw <personname> concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase
the <personname> boy cornered him
<personname> was not looking directly at <personname> his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder but as <personname> stared at him he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side
you no
or ministry decrees
mariettas mother minister she added looking up at <personname> is madam edgecombe from the department of magical transportation
unfortunately at that point this hex she waved impatiently at mariettas concealed face came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more
well now said <personname> fixing marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look
now will you tell me what happened at this meeting
cut in professor <personname>
he was heavily bandaged it is true but his hearing was quite unimpaired said <personname> smugly
he heard every word <personname> said and hastened straight to the school to report to me  oh so that is why he was not prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets said professor <personname> raising her eyebrows
oh very good minister very good <personname> could have kicked him
that is all very fine headmaster she said smiling sweetly
why do you think miss edgecombe is here
<personname> looked quickly at <personname> and then back at marietta
you have have not you
said <personname> in a testy voice
i would have thought her meaning was quite clear said professor <personname> harshly
is that correct miss edgecombe
well usually when a person shakes their head said <personname> coldly they mean no
marietta was standing exactly where <personname> had released her
a sudden suspicion connected to kingsleys whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into <personname>s mind
it appears that they were forewarned of my arrival however because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction
it does not matter however
excellent <personname>
said <personname> quietly
there was fear in both faces
but but  understanding blazed suddenly in <personname>s face
i see now that it was a mistake to invite miss edgecombe of course
<personname> cried <personname> now positively quivering with delight <personname> have you written it all down everything he is said his confession have you got it
duplicate your notes <personname> and send a copy to the daily prophet at once
you will now be escorted back to the ministry where you will be formally charged and then sent to azkaban to await trial ah said <personname> gently yes
i could break out of course but what a waste of time and frankly i can think of a whole host of things i would rather be doing
so sneered <personname> recovering himself you intend to take on dawlish shacklebolt <personname> and myself single-handed do you <personname>
not unless you are foolish enough to force me to
dawlish shacklebolt take him
remember close your mind  but as <personname> s fingers closed over <personname>s skin a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible snakelike longing to strike <personname> to bite him to hurt him  you will understand whispered <personname>
where is he
where is he
<personname> seemed not to hear her
you know minister i disagree with <personname> on many counts  but you cannot deny he is got style <personname>s worst memory by order of the ministry of magic <personname> jane <personname> high inquisitor has replaced <personname> as head of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
mungos with a pumpkin for a head it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was
they could not keep him away in our second year and they will not be able to this time
but members of the inquisitorial squad  the what
he never managed to get all the words out said <personname> due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that vanishing cabinet on the first floor
we would walk out right now if we were not determined to do our bit for <personname> first
nobody would have thought of throwing fanged frisbees down the corridors if i could have strung you up by the ankles in my office would they
to drink mr <personname> she said smiling still more widely
as she named each drink she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk
said <personname> who was still watching him
he raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip though keeping his mouth tightly closed
very good
now then  she leaned forward a little
i know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if i had had any proof neither of you would be at large today i promise you
it was not difficult to find
shocking pink catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers
they will be all over the school unless we do something stupefy a jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets
miss <personname> would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom
i could have got rid of the sparklers myself of course but i was not sure whether i had the authority beaming he closed his classroom door in her snarling face
only thing is we used our whole stock we are going to have to start again from scratch now it was worth it though said <personname> who was taking orders from clamoring gryffindors
now you mention it said <personname> happily dyou know  i think i am feeling a bit  rebellious
<personname> could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and <personname> went up to bed an hour later and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower still resolutely spelling out the word poo
he turned onto his side wondering how <personname> was feeling about her first day in <personname>s job and how <personname> would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption smiling to himself he closed his eyes the whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant  or perhaps he <personname> was simply speeding away from them he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the department of mysteries
there were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate he had to go on there was a door at the far end it too opened at his touch and now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves each laden with small dusty spun glass spheres now <personname>s heart was beating fast with excitement he knew where to go he ran forward but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous deserted room there was something in this room he wanted very very much something he wanted or somebody else wanted his scar was hurting bang <personname> awoke instantly confused and angry
his stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had occlumency the following evening <personname> spent the whole of the next day dreading what <personname> was going to say if he found out how much farther into the department of mysteries he had penetrated during his last dream
on the count of three then said <personname> lazily
asked <personname>
he was once again looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling in fact unless he was much mistaken he was looking down upon the great hall his breath was actually fogging the surface of <personname>s thoughts his brain seemed to be in limbo it would be insane to do the thing that he was so strongly tempted to do he was trembling <personname> could be back at any moment  but <personname> thought of <personname>s anger of <personname>s jeering face and a reckless daring seized him
sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent heads which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light
his hand was flying across the parchment he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbors and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped
he was very good-looking his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither <personname>s nor <personname>s could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully though he did not seem to have noticed
dyou think you managed to get all the signs
said <personname> in tones of mock concern
i got the snout shape the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail he said anxiously but i could not think what else  how thick are you wormtail
he was as deeply immersed in the owl paper as ever which left <personname> free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree
<personname> noticed his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the waters edge
this will liven you up padfoot said <personname> quietly
<personname> was on his feet again and was stowing the owl paper in his bag
what are you going to do snivelly wipe your nose on us
wash out your mouth said <personname> coldly
<personname> whirled about a second flash of light later <personname> was hanging upside down in the air his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants
<personname> <personname> and wormtail roared with laughter
take the curse off him then <personname> sighed deeply then turned to <personname> and muttered the countercurse
career advice but why have not you got occlumency lessons anymore
yeah well i do not blame you said <personname> angrily setting down his study schedule
and had not <personname> replied it is more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean
once or twice he even wondered whether <personname> had forced her into it for nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort of inspiration
why
times of individual appointments are listed below
said <personname> absently
good sense of when to duck more like  he was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking
he looked around <personname> and george had come to join them
and of course we would have messed up peoples studying too which would be the very last thing we would want to do
<personname> demanded of <personname> and <personname> was reminded irresistibly of mrs <personname> appealing to her husband during <personname>s first dinner in grimmauld place
you take notes for a change it will not kill you by the time they reached the dungeons neither <personname> nor <personname> was speaking to <personname> any longer
<personname> meanwhile seemed to have decided to act as though <personname> were invisible
his potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and <personname> was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure
another zero then <personname> <personname> was too incensed to speak
yes
in fact i do not think anybody has been taken on in the last three years
poisons and antidotes are essential study for aurors
said professor <personname> sweetly
a very good chance then said professor <personname>
aha shrieked professor <personname> pointing a stubby finger at <personname>
yes yes yes yes of course that is what you want is not it <personname> <personname>
<personname> swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room not daring to look at <personname>
pulling out her wand she hurried off in the opposite direction it was now or never
but he had made up his mind hitching his bag more securely onto his shoulder he set off at a run weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction off to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing <personname> reached the corridor where <personname>s office was situated and found it deserted
now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs
did i ever have the guts to tell you i thought you were out of order
how come she married him
even <personname>
well said <personname> slowly <personname> was a special case
i have got the form headmistress he said hoarsely waving the piece of parchment <personname> had just seen him take from her desk
if anyone fancies buying a portable swamp as demonstrated upstairs come to number ninety-three diagon alley <personname>s wizarding wheezes he said in a loud voice
then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in <personname> s office door through which <personname> and georges cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters
meanwhile it became clear just how many skiving snackboxes <personname> and george had managed to sell before leaving hogwarts
he and <personname> both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands
who cares
said <personname> irritably while his teacup stood drunkenly again trembling violently at the knees
said <personname> and <personname> together
yes i did said <personname> mutinously
said <personname> looking beadily at <personname>
he however seemed to have found a new optimism
as the teams zoomed out onto the pitches he named the players with something less than his usual gusto
and they are off said lee
and davies takes the quaffle immediately ravenclaw captain davies with the quaffle he dodges johnson he dodges bell he dodges spinnet as well he is going straight for goal he is going to shoot and and  lee swore very loudly
predictably horribly the slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing <personname> cannot save a thing he cannot block a single ring  <personname> said a hoarse voice in <personname>s ear
for some reason <personname> was bent double as though anxious not to be seen though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else
when they reached his cabin <personname> turned automatically left toward the front door <personname> however walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree
<personname> why are you armed
firenze said that they are angry because he went to work for <personname>
the centaurs
they were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all <personname> could see of <personname> in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him
it occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him as rather ominous
in fact  he stopped suddenly and turned around <personname> walked right into him and was knocked over backward
i don wan ter go of course but if it wasn fer  well  the special circumstances i am abou ter explain to you i would leave righ now before she is go the chance ter do it in front of the whole school like she did with trelawney
was the one he had been planning on asking
it was not a mound at all
oh <personname> why did you bring him back if he did not want to come would not he have been happier with his own people
said <personname>
absolutely minuscule he was bein kicked around by all of them i jus couldn leave him  did madame <personname> want to bring him back
asked <personname>
she well she could see it was right importan ter me said <personname> twisting his enormous hands
bu bu she got a bit tired of him after a while i must admit  so we split up on the journey home she promised not ter tell anyone though how on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing
i will admit he mighta taken a couple of swings at me when he is bin in a bad mood but he is gettin better loads better settlin down well what are those ropes for then
he can get his own food no problem
it was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling close-growing hair the color of bracken
he would do better to abandon it
kind of makes you wish we had norbert back does not it
they watched in great trepidation as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them
an this is <personname> see
you ought not to have meddled <personname> said magorian
there can be no return from such disgrace
it is not up ter you who comes an goes in here  no more is it up to you <personname> said magorian smoothly
you forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor firenze escape us
ruddy old nags though eh
i do not believe him
we will save our news till tomorrow shall we
said <personname>
i suppose she cried did she
no he cannot have well he has said <personname> firmly
teach him english yeah said <personname>
but unfortunately he made <personname> and me promise
less i spose said <personname> looking slightly alarmed
now fathers been friendly with the head of the wizarding examinations authority for years old griselda marchbanks we have had her round for dinner and everything do you think that is true
nothing we can do about it if it is said <personname> gloomily
oh i do not think it will make any difference said <personname> still more miserably
<personname> we wanted to buy that shouted <personname>
do not be stupid she snarled
i have had a look at it and it is actually dried doxy droppings
now i must warn you that the most stringent anti cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers
auto-answer quills are banned from the examination hall as are remembralls detachable cribbing cuffs and self correcting ink
<personname> and <personname> whipped around on their bench
through the doors to the great hall they could see <personname> standing with a small group of ancient looking witches and wizards
professor marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf she was answering <personname> very loudly considering that they were only a foot apart
<personname> turned over his paper his heart thumping hard three rows to his right and four seats ahead <personname> was already scribbling he lowered his eyes to the first question a give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make objects fly <personname> had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write well it was not too bad was it
ten minutes later professor flitwick called parkinson pansy patil padma patil parvati <personname> <personname>
<personname> walked into the great hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook
there was no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for transfiguration next day
they had their herbology exam on wednesday other than a small bite from a fanged geranium <personname> felt he had done reasonably well and then on thursday defense against the dark arts
very good indeed well i think that is all <personname>  unless  he leaned forward a little
the silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall
excellent he said
he was trying to guess what creatures they were examining he thought it must be unicorns because the boys seemed to be standing back a little when the portrait hole opened and <personname> clambered in looking thoroughly bad tempered
and what is more someone is put another niffler in <personname>s office i do not know how they got it through that new door but i just walked past there and <personname> is shrieking her head off by the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg  good said <personname> and <personname> together
and we do not want <personname> chucked out he is teaching at the moment she cannot blame him said <personname> gesturing out of the window
said <personname> who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off toward the girls dormitories banging the door behind her
sure enough he found the written exam difficult though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about polyjuice potion he could describe its effects extremely accurately having taken it illegally in his second year
with <personname> absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions
still at least we can give it up now
<personname> laughed just as <personname> came running up behind them
several people said ouch as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes hastening to see what was going on below
no fewer than four stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward professor <personname>
indeed he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over
there was a long minutes quivering silence everybody gazing openmouthed into the grounds
how come all the spells bounced off him
asked angelina johnson shaking her head
it was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows
he simply skipped question four in your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riots of the eighteenth century
he had a stab at question five how was the statute of secrecy breached in 1 749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence
i know this <personname> thought though his brain felt torpid and slack
it did not seem very informative or detailed yet he was sure <personname>s notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages he closed his eyes again trying to see them trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in france yes he had written that already goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too and nobody from liechtenstein had wanted to come think he told himself his face in his hands while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front he was walking along the cool dark corridor to the department of mysteries again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last the black door swung open for him as usual and here he was in the circular room with its many doors straight across the stone floor and through the second door  patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry he jogged the last few feet to the third door which swung open just like the others once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres his heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time when he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows but there was a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal <personname>s stomach contracted with fear  with excitement a voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness take it for me lift it down now i cannot touch it  but you can the black shape upon the floor shifted a little
the examination is nearly over but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely
what
saw it
but but where
but <personname>  said <personname> weakly
he wanted to shake her
he is got a point said <personname> quietly looking at <personname>
<personname> how on earth could <personname> have got hold of <personname> when he is been in grimmauld place all the time
that is not what i mean at all well spit out what you have got to say because we are wasting time here <personname> shouted
<personname> let out a roar of frustration
you do not get it <personname> shouted at her
never you mind said <personname> roughly
<personname> and <personname> looked at her
nobody answered her
okay she said her brow furrowed as she continued to pace
<personname> looked surprised at the readiness with which <personname> had come up with this lie
i  okay thanks he muttered
<personname> barely heard them
get over here muttered <personname> tugging at <personname>s wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column
a loud chorus of <personname> is our king if they see <personname> coming replied <personname> as <personname> inserted the blade of <personname>s knife in the crack between door and wall
his voice echoed around the room but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire
where is <personname> kreacher
i am warning you said <personname> fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position
kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now yes he has not had a chance in a long time kreachers master has been keeping him away from her  where has <personname> gone
<personname> laughed loudly and sycophantically
<personname>s slack face seemed to tighten
he had just realized something he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it
he had thought that all the members of the order all those who could help him save <personname> were gone but he had been wrong
there was still a member of the order of the phoenix at hogwarts <personname>
there was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the slytherins efforts to keep <personname> and the others under control
<personname> looked back at <personname> who was watching him closely
you wanted to see me headmistress
the only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling <personname> looked back at <personname> who stared at him frantic to communicate without words
you are being deliberately unhelpful i expected better <personname> always speaks most highly of you now get out of my office <personname> gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave
padfoot
what is padfoot
no <personname> <personname> well have to tell her no way yelled <personname> staring at the little of <personname> he could see
we  we wanted to tell him it is r-ready choked <personname>
said <personname> harshly her stubby hands still tight on <personname> s shoulders
<personname> contemplated <personname> for another long moment and then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice
get up now  professor said <personname> eagerly professor <personname> i think some of the squad should come with you to look after  i am a fully qualified ministry official <personname> do you really think i cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone
the sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest now as <personname> marched purposefully across the grass <personname> jogging to keep up
the ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours i am afraid
oh yes said <personname>
you will see they walked on for what seemed a long time until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light
she was wearing a triumphant smile
there was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them
we consider that a great insult human our intelligence thankfully far outstrips your own what are you doing in our forest
lifting his head a few inches <personname> saw that <personname> had been seized from behind by bane and lifted high into the air wriggling and yelling with fright
they brought her here <personname>an replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on <personname>
they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet
you are not welcome among us these words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on <personname>
really smart plan
anyway we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed
and they left you behind
anyway never mind that now
the problem facing them seemed insurmountable
well we will have to fly will not we
i spose we are going to ride on the back of the kacky snorgle or whatever it is
well we need three said <personname> who was still looking a little shaken but determined just the same
he had no excuse now all right he said angrily pick one and get on then
never ever again  that was the worst  <personname> and <personname> touched down on either side of him
both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than <personname> though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground
<personname> did it his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial
<personname> turned toward the plain black door
the circular wall was rotating
<personname> grabbed <personname>s arm as though frightened the floor might move too but it did not
for a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around and then quite as suddenly as it had started the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again
what are those things
do not know said <personname>
yes  i wonder what they are doing with them
sure enough there could be no mistake now that he saw them at close quarters
careful whispered <personname>
<personname> scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit
the pointed archway looked much taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down on it from above
the gently rippling veil intrigued him he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it
it is  locked  said <personname> throwing his weight at the door but it did not budge
said <personname> excitedly joining <personname> in the attempt to force the door open
it remained as firmly shut as ever
the wall slid back to a halt and <personname> with a feeling of increasing desperation pushed the next door open
this way <personname>s heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track
oh look
you dawdled enough by that old arch she said crossly but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it
they were there they had found the place high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small dusty glass orbs
they glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets set at intervals along the shelves
like those in the circular room behind them their flames were burning blue
the room was very cold
tiny yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf
they passed row eighty-four  eighty-five  <personname> was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement but <personname> might be gagged now or else unconscious  or said an unbidden voice inside his head he might already be dead i would have felt it he told himself his heart now hammering against his adams apple
they stood grouped around the end of the row gazing down the alley beside it
what
i  i do not think <personname> is here
<personname> moved a little closer
he stepped forward
in spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously and below that spt to apwbd dark <personname> and
what is it
he glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf
it is something to do with me is not it
the others moved in closer around <personname> gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust
<personname> gave a gasp of horror
<personname> said
she and her fellow death eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from <personname> and the others the light from their wands dazzling <personname>s eyes
<personname> felt <personname> stir beside him
do not do anything he muttered
you hear him
if <personname> really was not here he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all but the death eaters did not strike
and you will just let us skip off home will you
he just wanted to get them all out of this alive make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity  the woman stepped forward away from her fellows and pulled off her hood
repeated <personname> the grin fading from her face
several of the death eaters let out low hisses
a sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were <personname>s
said <personname>
someone made a prophecy about <personname> and me
the dark <personname> walk into the ministry of magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return
very good <personname> very good  said <personname> slowly
they might have run straight through to the hall said the rough voice
the second death eater however had leapt aside to avoid <personname>s spell and now pointed his own wand at <personname> who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim
you cannot hurt a baby there was no time to argue the point
<personname> could hear more footsteps growing louder from the hall of prophecy they had just left and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position
it passed right across <personname>s chest she gave a tiny oh as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless
the death eater kicked out hard at <personname>s head as he emerged his foot broke <personname>s wand in two and connected with his face <personname> gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose
<personname> seized his chance petrificus tot alu s the spell hit dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forward across his comrade both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch
but <personname>  we will dake her wid us said <personname> firmly
we saw uranus ha ha ha  a bubble of blood grew at the corner of <personname>s mouth and burst
said <personname> fearfully as <personname> continued to giggle still hanging off the front of <personname>s robes
<personname> get out of the way get down  but <personname> had already pointed his wand at the tank
she keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious
<personname> got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him
the death eaters all halted gazing at him
one was bleeding badly dolohov freed of the full body-bind was leering his wand pointing straight at <personname>s face
now hand me the prophecy like a good boy let let the others go and i will give it to you said <personname> desperately
he is dot alone shouted a voice from above them
<personname> no go back to <personname>  stubefyl <personname> shouted again pointing his wand at each death eater in turn stubefyl
he struggled and kicked several of the death eaters laughed
then high above them two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room <personname> <personname> <personname> <personname> and kingsley
he yelled as another spell soared inches over their heads
give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy  the man was pressing so tightly on <personname>s windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eyes he saw <personname> dueling with a death eater some ten feet away
its owner was lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon <personname> and <personname> dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee
springing up <personname> yelled petrificus totalusl once again dolohovs arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward landing with a crash on his back
now i want you to get out of  they both ducked again
both fell backward <personname>s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetles <personname> with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed
<personname> pointed the wand instead at <personname> but <personname> jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled impedimental <personname> was blasted off his back
just try and stand let us get out of   dubbledorel said <personname> his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over <personname>s shoulder
the laughter had not quite died from his face but his eyes widened in shock
<personname> released <personname> though he was unaware of doing so
to <personname> it was meaningless noise the deflected curses flying past them did not matter nothing mattered except that <personname> stop pretending that <personname> who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain was not going to emerge at any moment shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle <personname> dragged <personname> away from the dais <personname> still staring at the archway angry at <personname> now for keeping him waiting but some part of him realized even as he fought to break free from <personname> that <personname> had never kept him waiting before <personname> had risked everything always to see <personname> to help him if <personname> was not reappearing out of that archway when <personname> was yelling for him as though his life depended on it the only possible explanation was that he could not come back that he really was  <personname> had most of the remaining death eaters grouped in the middle of the room seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes
behind the dais there were still flashes of light grunts and cries kingsley had run forward to continue <personname>s duel with <personname>
<personname> had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where <personname> stood
let us let us find the others
where are they all <personname>
the hem of <personname>s robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming she aimed a curse over her shoulder
the room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask
aaaaaah  did you love him little baby <personname>
never used an unforgivable curse before have you boy
<personname> scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblins ears went flying across the room
and he knows said <personname> with a mad laugh to match <personname> s own
his scar seared and burned the pain of it was making his eyes stream liar she shrieked but he could hear the terror behind the anger now
and then he breathed <personname> <personname> looked behind him his heart pounding
it was foolish to come here tonight <personname> said <personname> calmly
the spell whatever it was caused no visible damage to the shield though a deep gonglike note reverberated from it an oddly chilling sound you do not seek to kill me <personname>
we both know that there are other ways of destroying a man <personname> <personname> said calmly continuing to walk toward <personname> as though he had not a fear in the world as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall
the snake reared from the floor ready to strike there was a burst of flame in midair above <personname> just as <personname> reappeared standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood
i saw him mr <personname> i swear it was <personname> he grabbed a woman and disapparated i know williamson i know i saw him too gibbered <personname> who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles
you here i i  he looked wildly around at the aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry seize him <personname> i am ready to fight your men and win again said <personname> in a thunderous voice
i will give you  <personname> pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and glanced at it half an hour of my time tonight in which i think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here
letters addressed to the headmaster will find me
he looked around and saw that he had arrived in <personname>s office
if his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him the pictures would have been screaming in pain
he walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think
oh do not tell me  he gave another shuddering yawn
a few more of the portraits had stirred now
as <personname>s tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake
he did not look at <personname> at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robes the tiny ugly featherless fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown fawkes usually stood
it seemed to him that <personname> was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused by his actions tonight and although <personname> was for once looking at him directly and though his expression was kindly rather than accusatory <personname> could not bear to meet his eyes
madam pomfrey is patching everybody up now said <personname>
mungos but it seems that she will make a full recovery
<personname> suffering like this proves you are still a man this pain is part of being human  then i do not want to-be human <personname> roared and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room
several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright and the portrait of armando dippet said a reallyl i do not care <personname> yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace
he had not flinched or made a single move to stop <personname> demolishing his office
his expression was calm almost detached
oh yes you do said <personname> still more calmly
he walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching <personname>
nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the department of mysteries tonight
if i had been open with you <personname> as i should have been you would have known a long time ago that <personname> might try and lure you to the department of mysteries and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight
<personname> turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place
the light fell upon <personname> upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard upon the lines gouged deeply into his face
i guessed fifteen years ago said <personname> when i saw the scar upon your forehead what it might mean
and this ability of yours to detect <personname>s presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused has become more and more pronounced since <personname> returned to his own body and his full powers
professor <personname> <personname> <personname> corrected him quietly
<personname> looked up
an old mans mistake  <personname> remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike on those occasions when he and <personname> made eye contact
he would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago and now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of <personname> none of it mattered  <personname> told me that you felt <personname> awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of <personname>s attack
<personname> could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to <personname>s explanation
<personname> of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and as he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant
he remembered worrying about kreachers odd absence over christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic kreacher told me last night said <personname>
he alerted certain order members at once
but <personname> did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you
he is not secret-keeper for the order he could not give the <personname>s our whereabouts or tell them any of the orders confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal
<personname> did not hate kreacher said <personname>
we wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long and we are now reaping our reward
please sit down
<personname> said nothing
my answer is that my priority was to keep you alive
and i had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead
did i believe that <personname> was gone forever
i knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty years before he returned but i was sure he would do so and i was sure too knowing him as i have done that he would not rest until he killed you
he stared at the floor for a moment then said but what is this got to do with  he could not say <personname>s name
an obvious flaw that i knew even then might be the undoing of it all
no  perhaps not
you did not ask me again however why <personname> had left that mark upon you
we discussed your scar oh yes we came very very close to the subject
i knew the time must come soon but you came out of the maze last year having watched <personname> die having escaped death so narrowly yourself  and i did not tell you though i knew now <personname> had returned i must do it soon
i was disappointed
from it he withdrew silvery gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them in the basin
it means me
<personname> surveyed him for a moment through his glasses
and so he did <personname>
you may perhaps have wondered why i never chose you as a prefect
details of the events that led to the ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that <personname> and a select band of followers known as death eaters gained entry to the ministry of magic itself on thursday evening
he has insisted for a year that <personname> was not dead as was widely hoped and believed but recruiting followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize power
he helped himself to a handful of <personname>colate frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to <personname> <personname> and <personname> and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth
how he had done it how he had emerged from the trees supporting professor <personname> without so much as a scratch on him nobody knew and <personname> was certainly not telling
<personname> sat bolt upright looking wildly around
still at least <personname> never found out what was in it either where are you going
er <personname>s said <personname>
whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company
<personname> raised his eyebrows
funny he said you would think i would have stopped walking around <personname> looked angrier than <personname> had ever seen him
ah
i am fine <personname> said quickly because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in <personname>s mind
well <personname>ys loads better behaved now loads
he was starting to wish he was alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice half emptying his glass
look  <personname> leaned toward him across the table i knew <personname> longer n you did he died in battle an thas the way he would have wanted ter go  he did not want to go at all said <personname> angrily
he knew one thing though unhappy as he felt at the moment he would greatly miss hogwarts in a few days time when he was back at number four privet drive
his breath misted the surface of the glass
outside his charms classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast  but just as he had given up hope he saw it a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor
i am not the only one who is late then
he desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely
can we go in here
<personname> asked as he closed the door
people can come back right
as ghosts
only  only wizards
i cannot answer said nick
well  well do excuse me  the feast you know  and he left the room leaving <personname> there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which nick had disappeared
he asked her frowning
i mean who  has anyone you have known ever died
she was a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day
ernie had never quite got over the indignity of <personname> docking points from hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the inquisitorial squad
what is er going on with you and her anyway
who is she with now anyway
but you were going out with him not anymore said <personname> resolutely
she scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned the quibbler upside down and began marking her answers
he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat
<personname> leaned an inch or so to the left to see where <personname> was pointing and there sure enough were the three <personname>s who looked positively appalled to see <personname>s reception committee
he and mr <personname> took the lead across the station toward the place where the <personname>s stood apparently rooted to the floor
you might remember me my names <personname>
about how he is treated when he is at your place
anyway that is not the point interjected <personname> whose pink hair seemed to offend aunt <personname> more than all the rest put together for she closed her eyes rather than look at her
<personname> we will have you away from there as soon as we can mrs <personname> whispered hugging him again
this particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week as though anyone needed reminding but also to explain why each and every one of them was the governments fault
or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the west country that had caused so much damage to both people and property
he hurried back to his desk straightening his tie as he went
furthermore <personname> was looking distinctly careworn
he was thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look
of course they were he said
the minister of magic only reveals him or herself to the muggle prime minister of the day said <personname> poking his wand back inside his jacket
for a time he had tried to convince himself that <personname> had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign
<personname>s a known muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin <personname>
when at last <personname> had stood up to leave the prime minister had stood up too
spluttered the prime minister
and a sphinx
no need to worry no need to worry shouted <personname> already with one foot in the flames
how should i know what is going on in the er wizarding community
snapped the prime minister now
what do you  i am afraid i  what
<personname> took a great deep breath and said prime minister i am very sorry to have to tell you that he is back
back
i do not really understand it and <personname> will not explain properly but anyway he is certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing so i suppose for the purposes of our discussion yes he is alive
maybe not said the prime minister standing up and striding about the room but i would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity do you really think i was not already making every effort
it was a a nasty killing was not it
i have never known them so united in my whole term of office said <personname> with a brave attempt at a smile
urgent
<personname> got to his feet and after a moments hesitation the prime minister did the same watching the new arrival straighten up dust down his long black robes and look around
said the prime minister anxiously
he has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity
with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized
leave me alone the woman named <personname> gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street
some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness
the dark <personname> is  i believe  mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone
in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone
her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room
but of course
dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from <personname> as she moved to stand behind <personname>
<personname> asked quietly
but in the meantime bring us drinks
there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs
<personname> i think we ought to hear what <personname> is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions
what have you been doing all these years that you have lived in <personname>s pocket
<personname> did not press the point
you know i presume that it was on the dark <personname>s orders that i took up the post
if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left
of course you were not a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine  gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad
he would have returned to power three years sooner
think said <personname> impatient again
it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of <personname> though i give you full credit for finishing him off
he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him
<personname> looked up at him her face eloquent with despair
<personname> is in jail and  she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids
the dark <personname>s word is law
he turned around to face <personname> frowning
<personname> she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks
that is why he is chosen draco is not it
you are <personname>s old friend
i beg you
you are the dark <personname>s favorite his most trusted advisor
yes the dark <personname> is angry <personname> very angry indeed
<personname>s mouth fell open
you will need your wand <personname> said <personname> coldly
and you will need to move a little closer he said
3 will and will not <personname> was snoring loudly
the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although ctd
the picture was moving the man was waving at the ceiling
scrimgeours representatives admitted that he had met with <personname> at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion
1
2
he knew it was pointless to keep rereading <personname> s words <personname> had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either <personname> was going to come or he was not
even as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of crisps across the room the doorbell rang
<personname> froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other
he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him
you can keep using it as headquarters said <personname>
you can have it i do not really want it
that is generous said <personname>
there was a loud crack and a house-elf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bats ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the <personname>s shag carpet and covered in grimy rags
will not will not will not will not
nobody was talking
<personname> whom <personname> has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own
until we meet again he said to the <personname>s who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room
i shall send them to the burrow to await us there
well here we go
the sensation does take some getting used to
your scar  has it been hurting at all
and what are we doing here
how can i help with that sir
correct said <personname> now turning up a steep side street
he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office
and  sir  i saw about madam bones
a terrible loss
he smiled at <personname> who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions
no i thought not
what exactly are they
the front door was hanging off its hinges
a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor
cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything
you mean he is
<personname>s jaw dropped
there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet
the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas
his legs were so short they did not touch the floor
cannot move like i used to
and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said <personname>
well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly
asked slughorn at once looking hopeful
once the door had closed behind him there was silence
do not think i do not know why he is brought you he said abruptly
oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on <personname>s face and wagging a stubby finger at him do not go holding that against me you will be gryffindor like her i suppose
the whole <personname> family had been in my house but <personname> ended up in gryffindor shame he was a talented boy
your mother was muggle-born of course
could not believe it when i found out
slughorn looked down at him in surprise
all ex-students all signed
you will notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet he is always interested to hear my take on the days news
all very well for <personname> to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while i am sure they are very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i do not personally fancy the mortality rate  you do not have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said <personname> who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with slughorn s cosseted existence when he remembered <personname> crouching in a cave and living on rats
<personname> went on
i cannot pretend that amelia boness death did not shake me
hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again
bye said <personname>
all right all right 111 do it <personname> turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room
you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts
he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him neither can live while the other survives  <personname> had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier
<personname> pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the <personname>s kept their broomsticks
<personname> swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him
no said <personname>
you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them
what will you be teaching me sir
oh a little of this a little of that said <personname> airily
<personname> laughed
which now i think of it ought to be some time later today
who is there
the door opened at once
there stood mrs <personname> short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown
<personname>s doing of course
a young witch with a pale heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands
wotcher <personname>
hi <personname>
both of you look as though you have had stretching jinxes put on you
she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove mrs <personname> sat down opposite him
of course he can be charming when he wants to be but <personname>s never liked him much
mr <personname>s hand had switched to traveling
why where are they
a considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood <personname>s school trunk
<personname> hooted happily at <personname> from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window <personname> knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting
same as usual said <personname> as <personname> perched herself on the edge of his bed they did not talk to me much but i like it better that way
how are you <personname>
she rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile
she will be delighted to see you again
oh  is she here too
i was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere is not much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens well enjoy your breakfast arry with these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her
she has not been much of a laugh lately said <personname>
i did not know that could happen said <personname>
said <personname> and george have got a real flair for business
he is going to be giving me private lessons this year said <personname> conversationally
blimey  private lessons with <personname> said <personname> looking impressed
<personname> emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye
i wonder what he will teach you <personname>
and evasive enchantments generally concluded <personname>
i wonder when our owl results will come
but why did not you oh my god you should have said  she leapt to her feet
i cannot go around looking like this forever you will not dear we will find an antidote do not worry said mrs <personname> soothingly
<personname> told me ow <personname> and george are very amusing said <personname> smiling serenely
but it is barely nine there is still plenty of time
three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time
he looked down at her half-amused half-exasperated
would not he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill <personname>
to mrs <personname>s displeasure <personname>s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by <personname> who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever
no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped
you can use our special bathroom now and everything wow i remember when <personname> wore one of these said <personname> examining the badge with glee
if you think securitys a laughing matter you can stay behind and i will get your things myself  no i want to come i want to see <personname> and georges shop said <personname> hastily
blimey  you cannot even make a joke round here anymore
e is always so thoughtful purred <personname> adoringly stroking <personname>s nose
a couple of hours i expect said mr <personname>
<personname> raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street
<personname> was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary
the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front amulets effective against werewolves dementors and inferi a seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby
i think we would better do madam malkins first <personname> wants new dress robes and <personname>s showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too <personname> you have grown so much come on everyone  <personname> it does not make sense for all of us to go to madam malkins said mr <personname>
<personname> do you think
mrs <personname> did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and <personname> while <personname> <personname> <personname> and <personname> set off for madam malkins
and i do not want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her <personname> and <personname> both standing there with their wands out and pointing at <personname>
<personname> who was standing slightly behind them whispered no do not honestly it is not worth it
he was as tall as she was now
madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart
and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop <personname> taking care to bang as hard as he could into <personname> on the way out
well reallyl said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust
she was distracted all through the fitting of <personname>s and <personname>s new robes tried to sell <personname> wizards dress robes instead of witchs and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them
yeah said <personname> unconcerned
<personname> <personname> and <personname> exchanged looks but before they could disabuse <personname> of this comfortable notion mr and mrs <personname> and <personname> appeared all clutching heavy packages of books
it was packed with customers <personname> could not get near the shelves
not for sale to under-sixteens
a beaming <personname> stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair
course it is said <personname> bracingly
come on <personname> i will give you a tour
here said george catching a couple and throwing them to <personname>
no charge
asked <personname>
but we are not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when she is already got about five boys on the go from what we have  whatever you have heard from <personname> is a big fat lie said <personname> calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf
they are really cute they are fairly cuddly yes conceded <personname>
cough up
mrs <personname> moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and <personname> <personname> and <personname> momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window
wonder where his mummy is
come on said <personname>
ouch shh look he is in there she breathed in <personname>s ear
he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear
extendable ears look fantastic said <personname> as <personname> unraveled the long fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door
well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible
no
borgin made a bow as deep as the one <personname> had once seen him give <personname>
not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand
what are you
oh er no i have not got quite that much said <personname> walking on
7 the slug club <personname> spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of <personname>s behavior in knockturn alley
yes i have already agreed it was fishy <personname> said <personname> a little impatiently
i will be careful not to slip in it
<personname> had better go first with  she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized <personname>s upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten
how did you
er  yeah all right we were not in the back room
very well then let us hear the worst
there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing
at last they found an empty compartment and <personname> hurried inside gratefully
<personname> bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it
while <personname> recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration newt with only an acceptable <personname> watched him without really listening
i what
it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that <personname> and <personname> entered the compartment at last
did not this look as though <personname> had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students
i do not think so said <personname>
i think he is  but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third -year girl stepped inside
perplexed <personname> and <personname> took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment
well i suppose we will have to go will not we
this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak
mclaggen a large wiry-haired youth raised a hand and <personname> and <personname> nodded back at him
belby who was thin and nervous-looking gave a strained smile
but the rest of the stories so sensational of course one does not know quite what to believe this fabled prophecy for instance  we never heard a prophecy said <personname> turning geranium pink as he said it
<personname> blaise any time you are passing
well off you go off you go as he pushed past <personname> into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that <personname> returned with interest
yeah he is a bit said <personname> his eyes on zabini
how come you ended up in there <personname>
what is wrong with this thing
<personname> seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into <personname> <personname>s lap and in the ensuing ruckus <personname> darted into the compartment leapt onto zabinis temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack
what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year
i might have er moved on to bigger and better things
even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features
when the dark <personname> takes over is he going to care how many owls or newts anyones got
of course he is not
maybe he does not care if i am qualified
to his relief <personname> seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck
<personname> could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that <personname> and <personname> would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied
you go on <personname> told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it
pansy left
he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond
there was a flash of red light and <personname>s body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at <personname> who was holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away
he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view
who did it
how did you find me
but what are you doing here anyway
no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too
and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence <personname> s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them
look
<personname> was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure <personname>s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews
i think you were better off with the old one said <personname> the malice in his voice unmistakable
then she was covered in darkness once more
as though he had read <personname>s mind however <personname> said no cloak
said <personname> grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection
you are covered in blood said <personname>
why should not it
<personname> looked up at the staff table and grinned at <personname> who was indeed waving at him
i thought he would have cured it by now though  or madam pomfrey would have done
the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right
personally i am going to keep my fingers crossed for another death
i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety
<personname> who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to <personname> to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of the gryffindors to draw ahead of him
we were having a good chat
come early an you can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the front doors into the darkness
<personname> shook his head
it would be like <personname> to make himself seem more important than he is  but that is a big lie to tell
<personname> sniggered
fanged frisbees are banned hand it over she told him sternly
the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows
but he thinks we liked the stupid subject dyou reckon anyones going to go on to newt
the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor <personname> needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary owl grades to continue with their chosen newts
he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said professor <personname> a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination
and so you did when professor <personname> was teaching the subject
you must not start off like that she said warningly
<personname> looked around as they entered
<personname> had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight
has an inferius been seen then
what is the advantage of a nonverbal spell
<personname> knew <personname> was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year
none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however
a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud
pathetic <personname> said <personname> after a while
detention saturday night my office said <personname>
i do not take cheek from anyone <personname>  not even the <personname>sen one
he tried to jinx me in case you did not notice fumed <personname>
like me
for you panted sloper
i am not sure yet said <personname> thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team
yours sincerely <personname> p
as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted <personname> and zabini with particular enthusiasm
a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at <personname> who grinned back lazily
i have not got a book or scales or anything nors <personname> we did not realize we would be able to do the newt you see  ah yes professor <personname> did mention  not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all
it is amortentia it is indeed
it seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it does
well well take twenty well-earned points for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially
<personname> looked rather as he had done the time <personname> had punched him in the face
amortentia does not really create love of course
sir you have not told us what is in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on slughorn s desk
it makes you lucky the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter
however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed  at least until the effects wear off
said terry boot eagerly
two perfect days
the person who does best however will win little felix here
<personname> of course seemed to have progressed furthest
having finished chopping his roots <personname> bent low over his book again
he passed over ernies navy concoction
excellent excellent <personname> good lord it is clear you have inherited your mothers talent
<personname>s face became stonier with every word he uttered
but he took a risk and it paid off
you have been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book <personname>
hey said <personname> indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced potion-making out of his bag and raised her wand
finished
or dyou want to wait and see if it does a few backflips
then i will have it back said <personname> snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor
<personname> wondered vaguely who the half-blood prince had been
good luck we will wait up we want to hear what he teaches you hope it goes okay said <personname> and the pair of them watched <personname> leave through the portrait hole
<personname> proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue when professor trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards reading them as she walked
i have arranged with professor <personname> that you will do your detention next saturday instead
well i have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted <personname> to try and kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given certain information
from here on in <personname> i may be as woefully wrong as humphrey belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron
said <personname>
it has a very great deal to do with the prophecy said <personname> as casually as if <personname> had asked him about the next days weather and i certainly hope that it will help you to survive
you look worried
his previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable
they walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing frock-coated figure ahead
then the lane curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them
ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope
<personname> lengthened his stride and <personname> hurried to keep up
despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before <personname>s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks
several of his teeth were missing
busybodies
he asked suddenly aggressive
i have already told you
that is it grub on the floor like some filthy muggle what is your wand for you useless sack of muck
and you think we are scum do you
he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again
merope raised her head
keep your seat said his father warningly in parseltongue
both <personname> and ogden yelled no at the same time ogden raised his wand and cried relashiol gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back
morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the wizengamot
the muggle morfin attacked
can you not think of any measure merope could have taken to make <personname> forget his muggle companion and fall in love with her instead
in any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal
<personname> left her while she was still pregnant
right said <personname> a little confused but reassured all the same
sir how exactly
but trials might take all morning the number of people who have applied
he felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his captaincy
the whole wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about <personname> being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times
and you have been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar
you can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway
said <personname> startled
it does not look like it said <personname> who was still reading
i mean  it is all looking serious is not it
his walk instantly became something more like a strut
we met on the train in old sluggys compartment he said confidently stepping out of the crowd to shake <personname>s hand
ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet
only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts
after two hours many complaints and several tantrums one involving a crashed comet two sixty and several broken teeth <personname> had found himself three chasers katie bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new find called demelza robins who was particularly good at dodging bludgers and <personname> who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot
that was the one he nearly missed
you have had your go
well done he croaked
you flew really well  you did brilliantly <personname> this time it really was <personname> running toward them from the stands <personname> saw <personname> walking off the pitch arm in arm with parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face
tricky shot from demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it  yes yes you were magnificent said <personname> looking amused
looked like he would been confunded
come off it you have ridden him have not you
git away from him hell have yer fingers oh
he walked over to the door and knocked loudly
if you do not open the door we will blast it open <personname> said pulling out his wand
righ
finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes
i got  them ter feed ter <personname>
i don think there is <personname> choked <personname> attempting to stem the flood of his tears
ar well then said <personname>
<personname> merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the hall after him but <personname> caught <personname> s arm and held her back
oh all right then i did it she whispered
but was not that dishonest <personname>
demanded <personname> reappearing in the doorway to the great hall and looking suspicious
her family owns a large chain of apothecaries and of course i hope very much that miss granger will favor me by coming too
i am sure i will be able to persuade him to postpone your detention
oh i wish you could come i do not want to go on my own said <personname> anxiously <personname> knew that she was thinking about mclaggen
<personname> reached out for a copy of the evening prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair
<personname>s heart sank
thanks a lot demelza
he did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks that sort of behavior as <personname> rightly said was indecent in anybody except <personname> who was simply weird that way
the only person who did not find these charms amusing was <personname> who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if <personname> had used the muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity
<personname>orrow said <personname> in a muffled voice i would rather you set the alarm clock
and then there was another flash of light and i landed on the bed again <personname> grinned helping himself to sausages
why does it matter if it is handwritten
now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him
<personname> came to his aid
the death eaters cannot all be pure-blood there are not enough pure-blood wizards left said <personname> stubbornly
the three of them turned to see professor slughorn who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop
it will not do mboy i am determined to have you miss granger loves them do not you
this strategy meant that <personname> was not left out and they usually had a laugh with <personname> imagining <personname> shut up with mclaggen and zabini
and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone
<personname> was still fuming when <personname> returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer
yeah it is my stuff he said
they rounded a corner in the lane sleet coming thick and fast blurring <personname>s glasses
<personname> said <personname> who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard and was wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat
i have seen that before said <personname> staring at the thing
how did katie get hold of this
take this necklace to professor <personname> at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf <personname> and the others followed professor <personname> upstairs and into her office
professor <personname> did not invite confidences <personname> though in many ways more intimidating still seemed less likely to scorn a theory however wild
i think <personname> gave katie that necklace professor
do you have any proof
<personname> took something to borgin and burkes for repair
and borgin just told me the price he did not say it was already sold or anything  well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five seconds of course he was not going to tell you anyway <personname> could have sent off for it since  that is enough said professor <personname> as <personname> opened her mouth to retort looking furious
because he was doing detention with me
or slughorn <personname> reckons <personname> really wanted him and they cannot be pleased that he is sided with <personname>
you are right said <personname> prodding <personname> out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again
you have had a busy time while i have been away <personname> said
still very unwell although she was relatively lucky
asked <personname> quickly
however i shall tell you in due course
professor said <personname> after a short pause did professor <personname> tell you what i told her after katie got hurt
it was brought in by a young witch just before christmas oh many years ago now
she said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious
happy to get ten galleons for it
i do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer
she had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward <personname>
yes
no i am a teacher said <personname>
how can he have done
well his name has been down for our school since birth  who registered him
here said <personname> waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper i think this will make everything clear
mrs coles eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment
i remember she said to me i hope he looks like his papa and i will not lie she was right to hope it because she was no beauty and then she told me he was to be named <personname> for his father and marvolo for her father yes i know funny name is not it
mrs cole helped herself almost absentmindedly to another healthy measure of gin
asked <personname>
i should not think so no said <personname> quietly
but i am jiggered if i know how he got up there to do it
he swore they would just gone exploring but something happened in there i am sure of it
he looked wary
she wants me looked at does not she
<personname>s reaction to this was most surprising
that old cats the one who should be in the asylum
it is a school of magic
<personname> had frozen his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of <personname>s as though trying to catch one of them lying
all sorts breathed <personname>
i can make things move without touching them
<personname> lifted his head
are you a wizard too
<personname> jumped to his feet <personname> could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there
and sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it
it was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box
that is easily remedied said <personname> drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket
then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked was my father a wizard
<personname> could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress
said <personname>
he she would his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of <personname> behind which he has been hidden for so long
the adult <personname> is the same
i mean it is really interesting and everything but what is the point
it says we are supposed to puncture them with something sharp
one of the reasons why <personname> would have preferred not to have to ask dean to play was that he knew <personname> would not like it
you prat <personname> look at the state of her i can fix that said <personname> landing beside the two girls pointing his wand at demelzas mouth and saying episkey
he gave <personname> a shifty grin that <personname> did not return as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for deans instant dismissal from the team
no i will not yelled <personname> beside herself
oh  er  the honest answer was yes but he did not want to give it
she is <personname>s sister <personname> told himself firmly
<personname> spent the day attempting to keep the peace between <personname> and <personname> with no success finally <personname> departed for bed in high dudgeon and <personname> stalked off to the boys dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him
he tried boosting <personname>s confidence all through dinner but <personname> was too busy being grumpy and surly with <personname> to notice
finally <personname> tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking <personname> into a defiant and hopefully goal-saving attitude but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement <personname> went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever
a few minutes later <personname> who had become so tired of <personname>s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table
<personname> watched her go without regret
<personname> had never really understood what a serious business quidditch was
that slytherin chaser vaisey he took a bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and he is too sore to play and even better than that <personname>s gone off sick too  what
what is wrong with him
he said in an undertone to <personname>
on the whistle  three  two  one  the whistle sounded <personname> and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away
well there they go and i think we are all surprised to see the team that <personname>s put together this year
said a snide voice and <personname> was nearly knocked off his broom as harper collided with him hard and deliberately
wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the snitch held high in his hand
laughing <personname> broke free of the rest of the team and hugged <personname> but let go very quickly
they were just about to leave when <personname> entered
i want a word with you <personname>
demanded <personname>
you know perfectly well what we are talking about said <personname> shrilly
he slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that <personname> had seen in his hand that morning
i wanted <personname> to think i would done it so i faked it when i knew you were looking
he did not see how he could possibly explain to <personname> that what she had done to offend <personname> was kiss <personname> not when the offense had occurred so long ago
er  does he
said <personname>
the door swung shut behind her
<personname> spun around to see <personname> pointing her wand at <personname> her expression wild the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward <personname> who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach
she cannot complain he told <personname>
<personname> did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before charms next morning quintessence a quest
<personname>s schedule was so full that <personname> could only talk to her properly in the evenings when <personname> was in any case so tightly wrapped around <personname> that he did not notice what <personname> was doing
he bent a little lower over advanced potion-making and continued to make notes on everlasting elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the princes useful additions to libatius borages text
hang on a moment he said slowly
yeah well never mind that said <personname> quickly
they would have picked up a powerful curse like the one on that necklace within seconds
so it would be down to <personname> to realize it was not a cough potion and he is not a very good wizard i doubt he can tell one potion from  <personname> stopped dead <personname> had heard it too
fancy a gillywater
look over her shoulder
she raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind <personname> deciding that her need was greater than <personname>s just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her
she said something about that <personname>
oh it is been all right said <personname>
she stopped two boys in our transfiguration class calling me loony the other day  how would you like to come to slughorns party with me tonight
<personname> turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise
anyonel and you chose loony <personname>
do not call her that <personname> snapped <personname> pausing behind <personname> on her way to join friends
<personname> tried to feel pleased that <personname> was glad he was taking <personname> to the party but could not quite manage it
what did you have to imitate her for
you are staying at hogwarts then
come in come in so many people i would like you to meet slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket
my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea  i am definitely not interested said <personname> firmly and i have just seen a friend of mine sorry
oh i have just escaped i mean i have just left cormac she said
yes i did and i am starting to wish i would chosen him mclaggen makes <personname> look a gentleman
you would have thought would you not that now i am returned to the school professor <personname> might have got rid of the horse
cormac has not asked me one single question about myself no i have just been treated to a hundred great saves made by cormac mclaggen nonstop ever since oh no here he comes she moved so fast it was as though she had disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished
no sorry said <personname> and he turned quickly to join in <personname>s conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking
the omens were never good <personname>
for you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance ah sybill we all think our subjects most important said a loud voice and slughorn appeared at professor trelawneys other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other
well then it is natural ability shouted slughorn
i do not think you should be an auror <personname> said <personname> unexpectedly
the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that
i was trying to gatecrash happy
a little afraid
<personname> stared at <personname>
<personname> ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from slughorn s office behind him
for the last time i did not do it okay
i am not trying to conceal anything from him i just do not want you butting in <personname> pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole
defense against the dark arts it is all just a joke is not it an act
now listen to me you are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like <personname> and <personname>  they are not the only ones i have got other people on my side better people then why not confide in me and i can  i know what you are up to you want to steal my glory there was another pause then <personname> said coldly you are speaking like a child
hardly daring to breathe <personname> remained crouched down as <personname> emerged slowly from the classroom
he said he would promised <personname>s mother to protect him that he would made an unbreakable oath or something an unbreakable vow
yeah well passing over <personname>s left buttock  i beg your pardon
bless them
you wait when i am seventeen  i am sure you will dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills yawned <personname>
i really do not know how you think of them
well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage
everyone should be comfortable
well they will have a bed anyway said mrs <personname> sounding slightly harassed
one of the two
gits said <personname> darkly watching <personname> and george setting off across the snowy yard
there was silence for a moment or two then <personname> said  course you know what they will all say
they did not hear him said <personname> flatly
oh come and stir my cauldron and if you do it right i will boil you up some hot strong love to keep you warm tonight
said mr <personname> whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling
be over soon
no problem said <personname> grinning
well something more  and he told mr <personname> everything he had overheard between <personname> and <personname>
yeah i thought you would say that
it comes down to whether or not you trust <personname>s judgment
he says it himself
we shall never be bosom friends perhaps after all that happened between <personname> and <personname> and <personname> there is too much bitterness there
the news would have leaked out anyway
i have been living among my fellows my equals said <personname>
he sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on i am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than i
who is grey back
greyback specializes in children
i did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me i even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform
sometimes you remind me a lot of <personname>
<personname> meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking <personname>
there are no wizarding princes said <personname> now smiling
i saw him in the pensieve he used it on <personname>
you know how these spells come and go
but it sounds like it was invented while you were at school <personname> persisted
you should definitely wear it in front of <personname> and george
if you tell them said <personname> shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow i i 111  stutter at me
<personname> stared at it
dyou reckon this is safe to open
do people usually give their house-elves christmas presents
asked <personname> prodding the parcel cautiously
<personname> would said <personname>
i would rather have them than that necklace said <personname> which sobered <personname> up at once
<personname> said so anyway
he was not however alone
then <personname> said rather stiffly merry christmas mother
you must forgive this intrusion he said when mrs <personname> looked around at him beaming and wiping her eyes
i mean  no no my dear <personname> said scrimgeour
oh perce said mrs <personname> tearfully reaching up to kiss him
no no i assure you i do not want to butt in well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden  ah that young mans finished why does not he take a stroll with me
nobody seemed to find scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know <personname>s name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the minister around the garden when <personname> <personname> and george also had clean plates
oh yes for a very long time
finally he decided on the truth  or a bit of it
<personname> could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron
and what has <personname> told you <personname>
the gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and <personname> kept his eyes fixed upon it
<personname> was silent so long that scrimgeour said looking from <personname> to the gnome funny little chaps are not they
the <personname>sen one you know  it is all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting things are happening
some would say it is your duty to be used by the ministry yeah and others might say it is your duty to check that people really are death eaters before you chuck them in prison said <personname> his temper rising now
either we have got <personname> pretending everythings lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or we have got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you have got the <personname>sen one working for you so you are not the <personname>sen one
i should not have said that said scrimgeour quickly
i do not remember you rushing to my defense when i was trying to tell everyone <personname> was back
the gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush
and you would not tell me if you knew said scrimgeour would you
a sluggish memory late in the afternoon a few days after new year <personname> <personname> and <personname> lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to hogwarts
only mrs <personname> was there to say good-bye as mr <personname> <personname> george <personname> and <personname> were all at work
mrs <personname> sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded <personname> in her arms
stay out of trouble
but we have been away how are we supposed to
and he is acting on <personname>s orders just like i said hmm  did either of them actually mention <personname>s name
not great said <personname> and he told her all about <personname>s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing
yeah but <personname>s bigger than me <personname> held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla so <personname> and george did not go on about it much  not to his face anyway  when can we take the actual test
dum er someone took him
but before <personname> could say anything about <personname> and <personname> <personname> spoke
he is not very happy with me
said <personname> angrily
scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you are not at hogwarts said <personname> still looking fixedly at his knees
he set dawlish to tail me
it was not kind
you will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to diagon alley and that i in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school
he was very guarded with me he felt i am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much
few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him they are too terrified
but then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left
there on the threshold holding an old-fashioned lamp stood a boy <personname> recognized at once tall pale dark-haired and handsome the teenage <personname>
you and he hurtled drunkenly at <personname> wand and knife held aloft
his face merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment
now he moved a little closer and said <personname> came back
when he awoke next morning he was lying on the floor quite alone
he handed over his wand which was proved at once to have been used to kill the <personname>s
half a dozen boys were sitting around slughorn all on harder or lower seats than his and all in their mid-teens
his right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt <personname> saw that he was wearing marvolos gold-and black ring he had already killed his father
tampered with
certainly said <personname>
and so for the first time i am giving you homework <personname>
<personname> however took a gloomier view
<personname> was disappointed he had hoped that <personname> might have been able to give him a clue as to what horcruxes were
<personname> reckons i should just hang back after potions this afternoon
and so finished slughorn i want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk
<personname> muttered to <personname>
<personname> was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron
slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did and instead had withdrawn his head hastily coughing as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him
slughorn reached their table last
what have you got to show me
oh you are like your mother
the only person in the room looking angrier than <personname> was <personname> who <personname> was pleased to see had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over himself
he licked his lips and said hoarsely what did you say
said slughorn
i have not found one single explanation of what horcruxes do she told him
i hope to be able to prepare you for your apparition tests in this time  <personname> be quiet and pay attention barked professor <personname>
<personname> had flushed a dull pink he looked furious as he stepped away from <personname> with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument
the headmaster has lifted this enchantment purely within the great hall for one hour so as to enable you to practice
the heads of houses moved among the students marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments
the important things to remember when apparating are the three ds said twycross
destination determination deliberation step one fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination said twycross
in this case the interior of your hoop
everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop then hastily did as they were told
<personname> bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop
the third was just as bad
remember the three ds he said and try again  one two three  but an hour later susans splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened
he flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it while <personname> watched impatiently
at once the marauders map appeared on the parchments surface
admittedly he spotted <personname> and <personname> moving around the castle on their own more often than usual sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors but at these times <personname> was not only nowhere near them but impossible to locate on the map at all
she had still not returned from st
want one
no thanks said <personname> looking up
the best way of finding out would be to tail him but even with the invisibility cloak this was an impractical idea <personname> had lessons quidditch practice homework and apparition he could not follow <personname> around school all day without his absence being remarked upon
i thought you just said
<personname> said <personname> suddenly
<personname> i cannot stand it you cannot stand what
why does that stop you having breakfast
<personname> blinked
romilda vane said <personname> softly and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight
he repeated
maybe i could ask if i can have them with her
great idea said <personname>
i generally sleep late on a saturday
you could not make him an antidote could you
asked slughorn
very handsome said slughorn smoothly handing <personname> a glass of clear liquid
brilliant said <personname> eagerly and he gulped the antidote down noisily
slughorn chuckled
this was the first time he had found himself almost alone with slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him
foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets
professor <personname> bellowed
then he found it the shriveled kidneylike stone slughorn had taken from him in potions
madam pomfrey had only let them enter at eight of the clock
and then i got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit slughorn ran for help <personname> and madam pomfrey turned up and they brought <personname> up here
lucky there was one in the room said <personname> who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone
having hurtled white-faced up to <personname> outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in <personname> and <personname>s obsessive discussion about how <personname> had been poisoned but merely stood beside them clench-jawed and frightened-looking until at last they had been allowed in to see him
no idea said <personname> frowning
i don believe this said <personname> hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at <personname>
jus don believe it  look at him lyin there
and for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed
before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory doors opened again and mr and mrs <personname> hurried up the ward
yer expect accidents don you with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether but attempted murder thas differentrent
said <personname> quickly
what is <personname> done
well
<personname> urged him as <personname> shuffled his enormous feet uneasily
out of bed so late this will mean detention no it won <personname> said <personname> shortly
did not look like he will be fit for next weeks match
it took <personname> a few moments to realize what mclaggen was talking about
oh  right  quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair
well then i will be playing keeper will not i
what
oh  there is one tomorrow evening
still checking the marauders map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever <personname> happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary
he could not decide which of them was more annoying
look why do not you talk to <personname> about all this
said <personname> surprised for he had found <personname> perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of <personname> and <personname>s row and keen to abuse mclaggen as much as possible
<personname> demanded suddenly
friends do not make me laugh said <personname> scornfully
i have told you said <personname> patiently he could be world-class and i would not want to keep him
he hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it
he was looking out of the windows he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw <personname> walking toward him accompanied by two girls both of whom looked sulky and resentful
you would better hurry up they will be waiting for the <personname>sen captain the boy who scored whatever they call you these days
this was infuriating he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was <personname> skulking off while the rest of the school was absent <personname>s best chance yet of discovering what <personname> was up to
so
there was little wind the clouds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight
just get up by the goal posts once mclaggen had marched off <personname> turned to coote and peakes
<personname> stared around for the snitch there was no sign of it
said <personname> vaguely
cracked skull said madam pomfrey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows
really brilliant when i get hold of mclaggen  you do not want to get hold of him he is the size of a troll said <personname> reasonably
<personname> sighed
i do not know  hogsmeade
i have never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map
quietly tentatively <personname> spoke into the darkness
look at the ickle creatures squabbling bitey bitey punchy punchy  kreacher will not insult <personname> in front of <personname> no he will not or <personname> will shut kreachers mouth for him cried <personname> in a high-pitched voice
yeah said <personname> twisting kreachers wizened arm into a half nelson
<personname> and <personname> are okay
just stick to <personname> like a couple of wart plasters
they are really excellent for warding off gulping plimpies
the gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs and <personname> took the spiral staircase two steps at a time knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight
what with apparition lessons and quidditch and <personname> being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what <personname> was up to <personname> had almost forgotten about the memory <personname> had asked him to extract from professor slughorn
that you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory
his single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble
now you will remember i hope that i told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation
but this was not <personname>s first choice of job
he wanted to stay here
<personname> was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusually gifted at doing this
ah  the house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her mistresss elbow
mr burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor said <personname>
he would never let me rest if he knew i would shown it to you and i am not selling not to burke not to anyone but you <personname> you will appreciate it for its history not how many galleons you can get for it
i think you will like this even more <personname> she whispered
she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box
i thought but a trick of the light i suppose  said hepzibah looking unnerved and <personname> guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in <personname>s eyes
whose memory is it
the one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge
i heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been
they do not call me <personname> anymore he said
will you let me return
will you let me share my knowledge with your students
why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want
why not try an open request for once
this is your final word
but i wish i could <personname>
why
ah no said <personname> staring horror-struck at the parchment
and kreacher ought to tell <personname> when he is coming to see <personname> so they can make their reports together what is this
<personname> already knew exactly how we were using the room did not he because that stupid marietta had blabbed
kreachers done well too said <personname> kindly but far from looking grateful kreacher averted his huge bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling the mudblood is speaking to kreacher kreacher will pretend he cannot hear  get out of it <personname> snapped at him and kreacher made one last deep bow and disapparated
how goods this
guffawed <personname>
the stone remained solid and unyielding
oh come off it he told the wall irritably
he did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling he was listening hard as though he might hear the door pop into existence
<personname> swore
before we start i want your dementor essays said <personname> waving his wand carelessly so that twenty five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk
sir said <personname> i have been wondering how do you tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost
i thought <personname> and mundungus were on the same side muttered <personname> to <personname> and <personname>
several other people were smirking
i do not know whether it is worth me taking the test
no said <personname> defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom
said <personname> curiously
twice <personname> had gone to his office and knocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone
he does not want to talk to me <personname> he can tell i have been trying to get him on his own again and he is not going to let it happen well you have just got to keep at it have not you
the short queue of people waiting to file past <personname> who was doing his usual prodding act with the secrecy sensor moved forward a few steps and <personname> did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker
he found <personname> and <personname> in the great hall already halfway through an early lunch
asked <personname> ignoring <personname>
repeated <personname> and <personname> together looking surprised
if you ask me said <personname> once <personname> had finished describing his conversation with <personname> she is cracking up a bit
and yet said <personname> coming out of her reverie i doubt you would find a woman who sulked for half an hour because madam rosmerta did not laugh at their joke about the hag the healer and the mimbulus mimbletonia
they were sitting with <personname> in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch
said the girl
<personname> i know you would have liked him
<personname> look at this said <personname> handing the note to <personname>
destination  determination  deliberation  she murmured
he died
well the rumor is that it was that fenrir greyback said <personname>
i want you all to brew me up something amusing that sounds good sir said ernie sycophantically rubbing his hands together
was it his imagination or did <personname> like <personname> look thinner
unorthodox but what a stroke of inspiration <personname> of course that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking
<personname> i passed well done he said
he he just failed whispered <personname> as <personname> came slouching into the room looking most morose
no joy said <personname> as <personname> joined them
but half an eyebrow like that matters i know said <personname> soothingly it does seem really harsh
so <personname> you going to use the felix felicis or what
yeah i spose i would better said <personname>
what
it was not strictly on the way but it seemed clear to <personname> that this was a whim on which he should act so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch where he was pleased but not altogether surprised to find professor slughorn in conversation with professor sprout
that enough for you
but this one <personname> the first one <personname> ever got it died last night
well he said with a most convincing hesitancy well if you wanted to come professor <personname> would probably be really pleased
you came croaked <personname> when he opened the door and saw <personname> emerging from the invisibility cloak in front of him
said <personname> looking up alarmed
you shouldn be outta the castle in the evenin i know it it is my fault  no no when he heard what i was doing he said he would like to come and pay his last respects to <personname> too said <personname>
i have never really had a lot ter do with horace slughorn before
thanks a lot
he heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and with an enormous grunt rolled it into the dark pit
why do not i say a few words
tha was  tha was  beauiful howled <personname> and he collapsed onto the compost heap crying harder than ever
there there said slughorn waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound
<personname> saw in his minds eye the expression on <personname>s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves and decided never to mention it to her
one for <personname>  said slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mugs  and one for me
he refilled <personname>s mug and his own and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how <personname> was able to look after them all
not long after this <personname> became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon slughorn who pocketed it with cries of to friendship to generosity to ten galleons a hair and for a while after that <personname> and slughorn were sitting side by side arms around each other singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called odo
aaargh the good die young muttered <personname> slumping low onto the table a little cross-eyed while slughorn continued to warble the refrain
cannot carry a tune to save my life
you liked her did not you
very brave  very funny it was the most horrible thing
the potions master seemed unable to look away
<personname> needs information
of course i am said <personname> calmly
horcruxes <personname> could feel the felix felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle
what sort of time do you call this
good gracious <personname> said <personname> in surprise
to what do i owe this very late pleasure
a couple of the boys around him smirked at each other
just so that you understand the term
splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature
but how do you do it
killing rips the soul apart
yes sir said <personname>
let us go
a bit  or more said <personname>
as far as i know as far i am sure as <personname> knew no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two
i do not understand sir said <personname>
a fragment of soul i was almost sure of it
what intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard
further than anybody and i thought i knew what that meant though the death eaters did not
he was already immortal you see  or as close to immortal as any man can be
that was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile without that he has no self at all
but how did you find it
he hid it protected by many powerful enchantments in the shack where his ancestors had once lived morfin having been carted off to azkaban of course never guessing that i might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin or that i might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment
the diary was not that special
do you think you know what they are sir
for the reasons i have already given i believe that <personname> would prefer objects that in themselves have a certain grandeur
four objects from the four founders would i am sure have exerted a powerful pull over <personname>s imagination
i am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders objects
you can use animals as horcruxes
he believed that in killing you he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined
the headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by <personname>s decision <personname> saw a few of them shaking their heads and phineas nigellus actually snorted
perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss  but he was not aware for instance that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of <personname>
<personname> sat in thought for a moment then asked so if all of his horcruxes are destroyed <personname> could be killed
but i have not got uncommon skill and power said <personname> before he could stop himself
so when the prophecy says that i will have power the dark <personname> knows not it just means love
<personname> singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him and in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him but it comes to the same  no it does not said <personname> sounding impatient now
<personname> himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress
he thought of <personname>
some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but <personname> knew and so do i thought <personname> with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parents that there was all the difference in the world
oh yeah said <personname> looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise
oh something really silly  she said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she could not climb in herself  but they have been a bit rocky for ages
the quidditch team said <personname>
they let me out of st
have a look in the book  <personname> pulled his copy of advanced potion-making out of his bag and looked up felix felicis
<personname> did not seem at all upset about the breakup with dean on the contrary she was the life and soul of the team
it would have been ideal if slughorn had given another of his little parties for <personname> would not be around but unfortunately slughorn seemed to have given them up
all in all the temptation to take another gulp of felix felicis was becoming stronger by the day for surely this was a case for as <personname> put it tweaking the circumstances
there seemed no chance of either while the final quidditch game of the season was looming <personname> wanted to talk tactics with <personname> all the time and had little thought for anything else
<personname> was standing with his back to the door his hands clutching either side of the sink his white blond head bowed
do not  tell me what is wrong  i can help you
his whole body was shaking
and <personname> realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that <personname> was crying actually crying tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin
blood spurted from <personname>s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword
<personname> let out a deafening scream murder murder in the bathroom murder the door banged open behind <personname> and he looked up terrified <personname> had burst into the room his face livid
<personname> was still sobbing and wailing overhead
it was a library book <personname> invented wildly
bring them to me here
<personname> turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom
i need a place to hide my book
i need a place to hide my book
he stuffed the half-blood princes book behind the cage and slammed the door
he paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter
you are quite sure of that are you <personname>
this is the copy of advanced potion-making that you purchased from flourish and blotts
said <personname> very quietly
i i do not agree sir said <personname> still refusing to look into <personname> s eyes
yeah i am said <personname> forcefully
you will not use magic
here you see  he pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read  <personname> and <personname>
aubreys head twice normal size
double detention
<personname> felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach
yes sir
we won four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty we won <personname> looked around there was <personname> running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him
<personname> ignored them
much more macho
prince <personname>
no way
this girl has not got anything to do with it
where did you get this anyway
well i am going to find out more about eileen prince if i can
anyway  without his bezoar tip  he drew his finger significantly across his own throat
thanks to <personname>  you still got detention with <personname> this saturday
indeed he had frequently wondered lately whether <personname> did not know this for he was keeping <personname> later and later every time while making pointed asides about <personname> having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered
i well i did not know students knew about  not all of them do said <personname>
but you could not get in and hide them
i have no idea said professor trelawney looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in <personname>s voice
right said <personname> hastily he had heard about professor trelawneys inner eye all too often before
said <personname> unable to help himself
she bent down scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche
i miss having you in my classes <personname> she said soulfully as they set off together
yes comical her voice rose rather hysterically and <personname> caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind
would <personname> have let me teach at this great school put so much trust in me all these years had i not proved myself to him
yes there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with <personname> who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs although i am afraid that i myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with <personname> you see he himself was seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tips well after that you know <personname> seemed much more disposed to give me a job and i could not help thinking <personname> that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes <personname> dear
she repeated uncertainly
nothing else mattered to <personname> just now
<personname>
<personname> shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time
he did not knock upon <personname>s door he hammered and the calm voice answered enter after <personname> had already flung himself into the room
only if you wish it of course
i believe so
yes said <personname>
when did you find out about this
he asked at last
please listen to me
<personname> paused biting his lip and looked into <personname>s lined face
he was still in <personname>s employ on the night he heard the first half of professor trelawneys prophecy
naturally he hastened to tell his master what he had heard for it concerned his master most deeply
<personname> did not speak for a moment he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something
i do not wish to discuss the matter any further
i take you with me on one condition that you obey any command i might give you at once and without question
i mean that you must follow even such orders as run hide or go back
if i tell you to hide you will do so
yes
<personname>
<personname> turned back to look out of the fiery window the sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon
then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room skidding to a halt where <personname> and <personname> sat looking stunned
i have got to be quick <personname> panted
say good-bye to her for me
i would better go <personname> s waiting  no said <personname> as <personname> unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion looking awestruck
i would like you to wear your cloak please said <personname> and he waited until <personname> had thrown it on before saying very good
it was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening
professor said <personname> quietly as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view will we be apparating
and stay out shouted madam rosmerta forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard
oh hello <personname>  you are out late  good evening rosmerta good evening  forgive me i am off to the hogs head
as long as nobody sees us go  now place your hand upon my arm <personname>
they brought the kids from the orphanage here
i think the journey alone would have done it do not you
<personname> looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps
when <personname> reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave
we need to penetrate the inner place
<personname> approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that <personname> did not understand
<personname> stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock
for a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack
<personname> i am so sorry i forgot he said he now pointed his wand at <personname> and at once <personname>s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire
their footsteps made echoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water
oh no  i think the horcrux is in the middle
his hand had closed in midair upon something <personname> could not see
how did you know that was there
<personname> asked in astonishment
it does not look like it was built for two people
i do not think you will count <personname> you are underage and unqualified
<personname> stood aside and <personname> climbed carefully into the boat
they were crammed in together <personname> could not comfortably sit but crouched his knees jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once
there was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boats prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center
<personname> pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion
i cannot approach any nearer than this
no matter how hard he pushed his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air
out of the way please <personname> said <personname>
you think the horcrux is in there sir
i can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk
said <personname>
<personname> made to speak again but this time <personname> raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard
it might paralyze me because me to forget what i am here for create so much pain i am distracted or render me incapable in some other way
professor
how do you feel
no  he groaned as <personname> lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him
he supported <personname>s shoulders and again <personname> drained the glass then <personname> was on his feet once more refilling the goblet as <personname> began to scream in more anguish than ever i want to die i want to die make it stop make it stop i want to die drink this professor
yes  he leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it
sir here <personname> yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over <personname>s face
lean on me sir
here  <personname> wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly
but i do not think  i can walk very far just yet
when did it appear
asked <personname> and his hand clenched painfully upon <personname>s shoulder as he struggled to his feet
do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak
no he said
yeah said <personname> who was panting
draco draco you are not a killer
you have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year
i have no wand at the moment
you are afraid to act until they join you
it seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it
he closed his eyes for a moment

why did not you stop me then
it so happens that i trust professor <personname>  well you are losing your grip then sneered <personname>
of course  rosmerta
got there at last have you
<personname> taunted
we decided to put the dark mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see who would been killed said <personname>
if you were going to kill me you would have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means
why else do you think i have not confronted you before now
because i knew that you would have been murdered if <personname> realized that i suspected you
<personname> winced at the sound of the name
no you cannot said <personname> his wand hand shaking very badly indeed
your father is safe at the moment in azkaban
she jeered
jokes
asked <personname>
frightens you
he was not looking at fenrir he did not seem to want to even glance at him
i did not know he was going to come  i would not want to miss a trip to hogwarts <personname> rasped greyback
now draco and quickly
i do not even know why the dark <personname>s bothering to kill yer come on draco do it but at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted  they have blocked the stairs reductol reductol <personname>s heart leapt so these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it created a barrier behind them now draco quickly said the brutal-faced man angrily
avada kedavrav a jet of green light shot from the end of <personname>s wand and hit <personname> squarely in the chest
out of here quickly said <personname>
<personname> could not have died
beyond them <personname> saw <personname> fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions so that they ricocheted off the walls around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window <personname> where did you come from
the man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face he wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister
<personname> flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds he could just make out three figures racing across the lawn heading for the gates beyond which they could disapparate by the looks of them the huge blond death eater and some way ahead of him <personname> and <personname>  the cold night air ripped at <personname>s lungs as he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry
no unforgivable curses from you <personname> he shouted over the rushing of the flames <personname>s yells and the wild yelping of the trapped fang
you all righ <personname>
<personname> could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt fangs reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him
i am all right panted <personname>
<personname>  but what happened <personname>
don say that said <personname> roughly
i saw it <personname>
<personname>s eyes however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower
said <personname> as he and <personname> approached the castle front fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles
<personname> fell silent the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud
<personname>s eyes were closed but for the strange angle of his arms and legs he might have been sleeping
we are going to the hospital wing said <personname>
it is <personname>s orders said <personname>
<personname> ran to <personname> and hugged him <personname> moved forward too looking anxious
no charm will work on these said madam pomfrey
greyback had not transformed so surely <personname> will not be a a real
where is he
the avada kedavra
madam pomfrey burst into tears
he says professor <personname> was involved in some  <personname> killed <personname> said <personname>
i always thought <personname> must know something about <personname> that we did not
would not hear a word against him i would love to know what <personname> told him to convince him said <personname>
<personname> believed <personname> was sorry <personname> was dead
all of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened
it is not your fault <personname> said <personname> firmly
but i do not think gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for <personname> because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a killing curse that just missed me
<personname> urged her
<personname> ran at it and got thrown up into the air  none of us could break through said <personname> and that massive death eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us
you said greyback attacked him
we do not yet know said professor <personname> looking helplessly at <personname>
we do not know what his behavior might be like when he awakens
<personname> is it true  is he really
and then <personname> did not quite see how it happened both women were crying and hugging each other
you see said a strained voice
<personname> will not be a full werewolf
the cases are completely  but i do not care either i do not care said <personname> seizing the front of <personname>s robes and shaking them
i have said all along you are taking a ridiculous line on this <personname> said mrs <personname> over <personname>s shoulder as she patted her on the back
this is  not the moment to discuss it said <personname> avoiding everybodys eyes as he looked around distractedly
professor sprouts got the kids back in bed
before i meet them i would like a quick word with you <personname>
and a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts <personname> was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk his half moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled
it is said <personname> very but he did not want me to tell anyone
but  there is one thing you should know before the ministry gets here though
said professor <personname> incredulously but before she could go on there was a knock on the door behind them and professors sprout flitwick and slughorn traipsed into the room followed by <personname> who was still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief
<personname> you have not said anything said professor <personname>
if the ministry thinks it appropriate said professor <personname>
he sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his invisibility cloak at the top of the astronomy tower but it did not matter there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass not even <personname> mrs norris or peeves
is it true
she let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him
<personname> shook his head
someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place
and he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left hogwarts for good just as <personname> had left the school had left the world  had left <personname>
<personname> on the other hand refused point-blank to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral
well i suppose if mum can stand it i can
i have not been sleeping that well since  well  i could do with some sleep
<personname> i found something out this morning in the library
rab
asked <personname> heavily slumping back in his chair
so  i was sort of right
he would play up the pure blood side so he could get in with <personname> and the rest of them
but why did not he turn you in
i do not think <personname> would have liked it very much if he would known
professor <personname> had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once
<personname> and <personname> alone of the da had responded to <personname> s summons the night that <personname> had died and <personname> knew why they were the ones who had missed the da most  probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting
they could not see clearly what was happening at the front
<personname> sat down next to his half-brother and <personname> patted <personname> hard on the head so that his chair legs sank into the ground
there was no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before
<personname> waited for somebody else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the minister but nobody moved
then several people screamed
<personname> listen  he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet i cannot be involved with you anymore
i knew this would happen in the end
<personname> he turned
scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at <personname> his expression shrewd now
glad to hear it said <personname>
that is right
<personname> whispered
<personname> seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to <personname> look let me go back and hit <personname> no she said firmly grabbing his arm
maybe it will not said <personname>
he had had the idea in his head ever since the night of <personname>s death
for me it started there all of it
and then what
the crowd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of <personname> a wide berth as he cuddled <personname> whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water
at your aunt and uncles house said <personname>
yeah we should not miss that he said finally
the more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him the more clearly the prime minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents
or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the west country that had caused so much damage to both people and property
it is not a very good time for me
seconds later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak a lime-green bowler hat in his hand
he had been standing alone in this very office savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the minister of magic was about to arrive and introduce himself
not to worry he had said it is odds-on you will never see me again
otherwise it is live and let live
and i must say you are taking it a lot better than your predecessor
at this the prime minister had found his voice at last
look
fve just come from azkaban <personname> had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket
<personname> had talked for more than an hour
well <personname> says he is said <personname> as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin but we have never found him
yes three said <personname>
less than two years later <personname> had erupted out of the fire yet again this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from azkaban
i have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without  we have the same concerns <personname> interrupted
<personname> has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of azkaban in january said <personname> speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur
maybe not said the prime minister standing up and striding about the room but i would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity do you really think i was not already making every effort
trees uprooted roofs ripped off lampposts bent horrible injuries  it was the death eaters said <personname>
but that murder was in the newspapers said the prime minister momentarily diverted from his anger
the prime minister sank weak-kneed into the nearest chair
it is very kind of you prime minister but there is nothing
there were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp
scrimgeour grasped it briefly his eyes scanning the room then pulled out a wand from under his robes
a highly trained auror who has been assigned to you for your protection
what about him
surely a bit of a rest  maybe go easy on the drink a team of healers from st
said the prime minister anxiously
spinners end many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime ministers windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown rubbish strewn banks
with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized
just a fox said a womans voice dismissively from under the hood
the other woman bella followed at once
side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness
she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up
<personname> he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them
as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said <personname> lazily
i was under the impression that the dark <personname> placed you here to assist me
<personname> refilled their glasses
before i answer you oh yes <personname> i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark <personname> before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn
i know he believes you but  you think he is mistaken
if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left
while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing <personname>s pet not quite said <personname> calmly
seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse  tempt me into my old ways
i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban
that is easily answered
but you did not return when he came back you did not fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn  correct
think said <personname> impatient again
i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like <personname> did not i
what is done is done
<personname>
it was only <personname>s protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me
i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle
and through all this we are supposed to believe <personname> has never suspected you
asked <personname>
i am one of the few the dark <personname> has told
i thought you must know about it said <personname> breathing more freely
and i will say this for draco he is not shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect  <personname> began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at <personname>
to punish <personname>
i cannot pretend that the dark <personname> is not angry with <personname>
then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked <personname>
drink this
it might be possible  for me to help draco
she sat up her face paper-white her eyes huge
there was a moments silence
the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair
owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk
nevertheless highly placed sources within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy
this one bore the headline scrimgeour succeeds <personname> most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face
the picture was moving the man was waving at the ceiling
<personname> is known to ctd
most seem reassured by the new ministers tough stand on student safety
inside it was a magnificent snowy owl
3
5
they may have been put under the imperius curse see page 4
6
any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately
<personname> had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat
i shall explain this more fully when i see you
the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl <personname> safely in her cage
<personname> jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk
downstairs in the living room his uncle <personname> shouted who the blazes is calling at this time of night
there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard
i must say your agapanthus are flourishing
yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said <personname>
<personname> had entered the room <personname> at his shoulder and <personname> skulking behind them both
a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair
the <personname>s after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads
but first of all i must tell you that <personname>s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned
this is in the main fairly straightforward <personname> went on
and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of <personname>s living relatives which would mean his cousin <personname>
<personname> <personname>s killer inherit his house
we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from <personname>s hands
it looked as though uncle <personname> was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt <personname> and <personname> and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on <personname> s wand
there was a loud crack and a house-elf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bats ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the <personname>s shag carpet and covered in grimy rags
kreacher will not kreacher will not kreacher will not croaked the house-elf quite as loudly as uncle <personname> stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears
kreacher belongs to miss <personname> oh yes kreacher belongs to the <personname>s kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher will not go to the <personname> brat kreacher will not will not will not  as you can see <personname> said <personname> loudly over kreachers continued croaks of will not will not will not kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership
if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there
he was thrilled to see buckbeak again
i will just go and er finish off said <personname> hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers
and he turned to speak to the <personname>s once more
uncle <personname> muttered preposterous but <personname> ignored him
us mistreat dudders
when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket <personname> waved his wand and the trunk cage and <personname> vanished
the memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened <personname>s sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of <personname> s most prized possessions
if there is an attack said <personname> i give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you
he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive
i thought you had to be seventeen
asked <personname> looking down at him solicitously
the sensation does take some getting used to
i thought it would be burning all the time now <personname>s getting so powerful again
professor why could not we just apparate directly into your old colleagues house
and  sir  i saw about madam bones
yes i received one myself said <personname> still smiling
you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor <personname> and not an impostor
i did not  <personname> began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not
he killed enough people to make an army of them of course
lumos
<personname> followed gazing around half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body
you mean he is
there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet
knew there was something  ah well
<personname> smiled at <personname> and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp
hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes
rheumatism too
i am undoubtedly slower than i was
now if you were to return to hogwarts  if you are going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath <personname> i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since <personname> <personname> left if that is how you treat teachers these days  professor <personname> ran afoul of our centaur herd said <personname>
your mother slughorn added in answer to <personname>s questioning look
you must have done been in the papers for the last couple of years died a few weeks ago  it was as though an invisible hand had twisted <personname>s intestines and held them tight
he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction
i reckon the staff are safer than most people while <personname> s headmaster he is supposed to be the only one <personname> ever feared is not he
upset stomach
i do love knitting patterns
you are leaving
our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to
i did not do anything said <personname> in surprise
at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over <personname>
if you will grasp my arm
i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it <personname> but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry
permit me to say that i think <personname> would have been proud of you
<personname> would not have wanted that would he
but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into <personname>s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight i will make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and <personname> too if i can manage it
and now everyone knows that i am the one  no they do not interrupted <personname>
it is true however that many have guessed correctly that <personname> sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you
said <personname> surprised out of his preoccupied silence
yes
i see a light in the kitchen
declare yourself it is i <personname> bringing <personname>
there stood mrs <personname> short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown
night  dear why not come to dinner at the weekend <personname> and <personname> are coming
are you hungry <personname>
yeah i am said <personname> suddenly realizing just how hungry he was
oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said mrs <personname> rapping a large iron pot with her wand
so you see it is a very important job and i tell him it is just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that muggle rubbish
but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear
just sling them around your neck and you will be able to change your appearance at will
are you sure
<personname> saw mrs <personname> glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen
all the hands were once again at mortal peril
though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what <personname> thought was gunpowder
seconds later or so it seemed to <personname> he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open
when did you get here
oh i am fine said <personname> who was scrutinizing <personname> as though he was sickening for something
he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss <personname>s death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said what is the time
so what is been going on
you have been off with <personname> it was not that exciting
he looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin said <personname>
no of course not so um did slughorn seem like he will be a good teacher
<personname> asked
<personname> was astonished to hear <personname> talking about mrs <personname> like this and could not blame <personname> for saying angrily cannot you two lay off her for five seconds
but his question was answered before he could finish it
arry she said in a throaty voice
i ave been longing to see i am
er congratulations she swooped down upon him and kissed him again
it was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center  including you and dad said <personname> slyly
but <personname>s not that down-to-earth
<personname> still seemed slightly punch-drunk he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water
she keeps trying to get <personname> round for dinner
i think she is hoping <personname> will fall for <personname> instead
i hope he does i would much rather have her in the family
she cannot change her appearance like she used to explained <personname>
i think her powers must have been affected by shock or something
<personname> she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch
i only just remembered said <personname> honestly
his voice tailed away
neither <personname> nor <personname> spoke
we wondered after we got back from the ministry  obviously we did not want to say anything to you but from what <personname> said about the prophecy how it was about you and <personname> well we thought it might be something like this
it just will not budge mrs <personname> was saying anxiously standing over <personname> with her wand in her hand and a copy of the healers helpmate open at bruises cuts and abrasions
this has always worked before i just cannot understand it
i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back  <personname> will you shut up you are not the only one who is nervous barked <personname>
<personname> asked the room at large but it was again <personname> who answered
at beauxbatons said <personname> complacently we ad a different way of doing things
<personname> was pointing through the kitchen window
well done said mrs <personname> proudly ruffling <personname>s hair
how did you do
moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago
there have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as mrs <personname> passed him a large slice of birthday cake
and they have found <personname>s body in a shack up north
<personname> interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach
why
talking of diagon alley said mr <personname> looks like ollivanders gone too
that is the one
no sign of a struggle
thanks <personname> said <personname> pocketing his gold
he and mrs <personname> were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa
we did not know security meant you i know jus like old times is it not
he called at mrs <personname> as they passed leering at <personname>
yes but do not go arresting anyone now dear we are in a hurry said mrs <personname> nervously consulting a list
mrs <personname> did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and <personname> while <personname> <personname> <personname> and <personname> set off for madam malkins
i want to send them flowers
he was as tall as she was now
madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart
<personname> smiled unpleasantly
think
well reallyl said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust
asked <personname> brightly when they reappeared at his side
there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in self inking spell-checking and smart-answer varieties
a space cleared in the crowd and <personname> pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangman spell it or he will swing  patented daydream charms    <personname> had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship
not for sale to under-sixteens
a beaming <personname> stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair
your punching telescope she said ruefully
she asked
giving him the tour
you do not pay here said <personname> firmly waving away <personname>s gold
but  you gave us our start-up loan we have not forgotten said george sternly
do they work
she asked
i dumped him he was a bad loser said <personname> putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it
look they are so sweet
why though
mr <personname> was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards
come on said <personname>
just hurry but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted
they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all
if only we could hear what they are saying said <personname>
why do not you bring it into the shop
well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible
he is a family friend
could you see what he pointed at when he said that one
if you have got one and a half thousand galleons said mr borgin coldly
get out <personname> did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels
to his slight annoyance however neither <personname> nor <personname> seemed quite as curious about <personname>s activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days
yes i have already agreed it was fishy <personname> said <personname> a little impatiently
remember that shriveled-up arm <personname> had
it was his left arm
there is a lot of phlegm around
<personname> and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids <personname> and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer
he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and three-quarters where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd
because i thought <personname> was up to something said <personname> disregarding mr <personname>s look of mingled exasperation and amusement
well
and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him
like they were a pair
there is something else
after a moment he said <personname> i doubt whether <personname> would allow a sixteen-year-old  does anyone really know what <personname> would or would not do
he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that <personname> did not hang around with him <personname> and <personname> while at school
let us find seats said <personname> and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students
she bought me a new wand look he pulled it out and showed it to <personname>
oh said the girl looking very surprised
then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler
but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and <personname>
<personname> and <personname> caught each others eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch
not like him though is it
belby who was thin and nervous-looking gave a strained smile
well of course i daresay he is busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby
beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out
<personname> lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off <personname>s forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place
well who cares what he is interested in
what is he when you come down to it
and you think you will be able to do something for him
maybe the job he wants me to do is not something that you need to be qualified for said <personname> quietly
i can see hogwarts said <personname> clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window
he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and <personname> looked up at the luggage rack frowning
<personname> could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that <personname> and <personname> would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied
pansy left
people were filing past descending onto the dark platform
what had <personname> wanted to hide from pansy
he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond
but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard
then he remembered that some wizards like <personname> could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words accio wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened
i can fix your nose if you stand still
no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too
he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy <personname> behind
securitys been tightened a hundredfold this summer
there is no need to wait <personname> <personname> is quite ah safe in my hands
still <personname> remained silent though he thought his chest might explode
he knew that <personname> had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment <personname> without anyone else listening
you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted i am sure
of course <personname> would spread the story as far and wide as he could but there was always a chance it would not reach too many gryffindor ears
bumped into him said <personname> evasively
<personname> was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause
all wanting to know if you really are the <personname>sen one  there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward <personname> so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff
those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual
the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right
quirrell actually died doing it
now as everybody in this hall knows <personname> and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength
<personname>s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more
<personname> had darted ahead to fulfill her prefects duty of shepherding the first years but <personname> remained with <personname>
what really happened to your nose
with what <personname> considered pure pigheadedness however <personname> was unimpressed
so how come you were late <personname>
got held up on the train said <personname>
you will be amazed
come early an you can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the front doors into the darkness
<personname> could tell that <personname> was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself
hoping for some support for his theory <personname> lost no time in telling <personname> what he had overheard <personname> saying on the hogwarts express
i mean when has any of us expressed  you know  any enthusiasm
we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like <personname>
w
t level
i just do not think you would be able to cope with the coursework
w
you must not start off like that she said warningly
i bet <personname> gives us loads
these pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the dementors kiss a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon the ground
you are i believe complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells
what is the advantage of a nonverbal spell
one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking
there is no need to call me sir professor
detention saturday night my office said <personname>
whenre you holding trials
<personname> and <personname> had evidently failed to achieve the required owl grade but four slytherins had made it through including <personname>
<personname> ernie said portentously holding out his hand as <personname> approached did not get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning
<personname> <personname> and <personname> sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons
they chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents <personname> had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow
a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at <personname> who grinned back lazily
<personname>s hand was fastest once more
quite right you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen
granger
<personname> saw <personname> lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from <personname> to <personname> who was sitting next to her
<personname> turned to <personname> with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him i am the best in the year
whispered <personname> who for some reason looked annoyed
amortentia does not really create love of course
however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed  at least until the effects wear off
twice in my life said slughorn
two perfect days
he gazed dreamily into the distance
<personname> bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him
sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas <personname>
how are you doing that
and times  up called slughorn
he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in <personname>s cauldron
he looked around and saw that <personname> had joined them
it is nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice
it is not like you know <personname>s diary
we ought to check that there is nothing odd about it
then i will have it back said <personname> snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor
10 the house of gaunt for the rest of the weeks potions lessons <personname> continued to follow the half-blood princes instructions wherever they deviated from libatius borages with the result that by their fourth lesson slughorn was raving about <personname>s abilities saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented
<personname> meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instructions but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the princes
good luck we will wait up we want to hear what he teaches you hope it goes okay said <personname> and the pair of them watched <personname> leave through the portrait hole
ten of spades violence
ah good evening <personname>
it was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice
sir he added
but you think you are right
sir said <personname> tentatively does what you are going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy
where are we going sir
before <personname> had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane
<personname> and <personname> followed
his eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions
said gaunt aggressively
cannot just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself
intruders
mr gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to morfin
morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again
come in the bleeding house then and much good it will do you the house seemed to contain three tiny rooms
two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined
she was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it
mdaughter merope said gaunt grudgingly as ogden looked inquiringly toward her
good morning said ogden
mr gaunt please said ogden in a shocked voice as merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two
the pot mended itself instantly
gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at ogden but seemed to think better of it instead he jeered at his daughter lucky the nice man from the ministrys here is not it
what is that then his sentence
i am head of the magical law enforcement squad said ogden
that is right roared gaunt
see this
mr gaunt said ogden doggedly i am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand
it is clear from your sons attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions
he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again
gaunt froze listening his eyes wide
it is not ours said a young mans voice
so he would not have you anyway
what happened to the girl in the cottage
azkaban had greatly weakened marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottage
<personname> considered him for a moment then said yes i think mr <personname> and miss granger have proved themselves trustworthy
good night
so i was <personname> agreed
have you always had it
<personname> hesitated
and you have been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar
you can still see where those brains got hold of me in the ministry look said <personname> shaking back his sleeves
are you mad
and an arrest
what
stanley shunpike  conductor on the popular wizarding conveyance the knight bus has been arrested on suspicion of death eater activity
she looked up with a troubled expression on her face
cormac mclaggen keeper
you did not try out last year did you
only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts
rubbish said <personname> coldly
he thought for a moment that mclaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threats to thin air
i thought i was going to miss that fourth penalty <personname> was saying happily
since when have you called me <personname>
missed me have you
<personname> was hungry enough even for <personname>s cooking and took one at once
but none of us could fit it into our schedules yeah
what are they <personname>
and they grow into
ar i always knew you would find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables he said gruffly pouring them more tea
even if you applied fer time-turners  we could not have done said <personname>
it was in the daily prophet
<personname> blushed
it was as though <personname> was not present slughorn did not so much as look at him
i am sure i will be able to persuade him to postpone your detention
the common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down <personname> who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling
not really  <personname> had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages
so you see <personname> cannot have brought in anything dangerous momentarily stymied <personname> watched <personname> playing with arnold the pygmy puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection
there did not seem to be any way <personname> could have brought a dangerous or dark object into the school
he says you are to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention er no matter how many party invitations you have received
silver and opals where was <personname> and what was he doing
<personname> rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells something <personname> had been quick to comment on in every dada class
on the other hand the prince had proved a much more effective teacher than <personname> so far
well  yeah it was but so what
because it is probably not ministry of magic approved said <personname>
and also she added as <personname> and <personname> rolled their eyes because i am starting to think this prince character was a bit dodgy
he had only just remembered
what
they were abusing it
they bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop
holding him fast with one hand he pulled out his wand
<personname>s thoughts strayed to <personname> as they trudged up the road to hogwarts through the frozen slush
scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on
<personname> <personname> and <personname> rushed forward to help but even as they grabbed katies legs she fell on top of them <personname> and <personname> managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her
instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them
let me see her something is happened to her sobbed leanne
it is leanne is not it
<personname> bent down his hand outstretched but <personname> seized his arm and pulled him back
<personname> knows about this necklace
she said she came back from the bathroom with it she did not necessarily get it in the bathroom itself  <personname> said <personname> warningly
good lord said professor <personname> looking alarmed as she took the necklace from <personname>
at this point leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her
what happened when katie touched the necklace
do you have any proof
no professor he just wanted borgin to tell him how to mend something he did not have it with him
oh <personname> said <personname> despairingly it would be all wrapped up so he would not have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would see it i think whatever he reserved at borgin and burkes was noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street and in any case she pressed on loudly before <personname> could interrupt i asked borgin about the necklace do not you remember
good day to you all
she held open her office door
dilligrout said <personname> firmly as they reached the fat lady
the pensieve was sitting on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling
still very unwell although she was relatively lucky
of course that made it near enough priceless
of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen
yes merope <personname> chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly <personname>
come in she is on er way
my name is <personname>
mrs cole blinked
then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before
i remember it clear as anything because i would just started here myself
we wondered whether she came from a circus and she said the boys surname was to be <personname>
she squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him
i should not think so no said <personname> quietly
he swore they would just gone exploring but something happened in there i am sure of it
<personname> drew up the hard wooden chair beside <personname> so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor
professor
he looked wary
i can make animals do what i want them to do without training them
<personname> raised his eyebrows
<personname> took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them
all new wizards must accept that in entering our world they abide by our laws
asked <personname> looking up
i am used to doing things for myself i go round london on my own all the time
i think that will do said the white-haired <personname> at <personname>s side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the present-day office
sit down said <personname> landing beside <personname>
said <personname>
but before we part i want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings
<personname> nodded
<personname> got to his feet
the weekends brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse
i mean it is really interesting and everything but what is the point
gwenog jones
<personname> groaned
but he was not sure how he felt about it
he and <personname> were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if <personname> and <personname> started going out together then split up
<personname> was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of katies substitute
<personname> had no reason to regret his choice once he saw dean fly that evening he worked well with <personname> and demelza
the beaters peakes and coote were getting better all the time
i want a word with my dear brother dean left looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene
it is just because she is <personname>s sister he told himself
<personname> asked abruptly as they approached the fat lady
it was natural that he should feel protective  natural that he should want to look out for her  want to rip dean limb from limb for kissing her  no  he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling
she is out-of-bounds
<personname> awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which <personname> had chased him with a beaters bat but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream <personname> for the real one who was not only cold-shouldering <personname> and dean but also treating a hurt and bewildered <personname> with an icy sneering indifference
what was more <personname> seemed to have become overnight as touchy and ready to lash out as the average blast ended skrewt
to <personname>s dismay <personname>s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days
demelza pull yourself together you played really well today
he tried boosting <personname>s confidence all through dinner but <personname> was too busy being grumpy and surly with <personname> to notice
yet if <personname> played as he had done in the last few practices their chances of winning were very slim
<personname> grinned and waved <personname> grimaced weakly and shook his head
a few minutes later <personname> who had become so tired of <personname>s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table
said <personname>
<personname> had never really understood what a serious business quidditch was
conditions look ideal said <personname> ignoring <personname>
lucky i call it said <personname> looking slightly more animated
i  you  <personname> had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited
many hufflepuffs and ravenclaws had taken sides too amidst all the yelling and clapping <personname> could distinctly hear the roar of <personname>s famous lion-topped hat
many thought given <personname>ald <personname>s patchy performance as keeper last year that he might be off the team but of course a close personal friendship with the captain does help
that is right smith he is muttered <personname> grinning to himself as he dived amongst the chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive snitch
with half an hour of the game gone gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero <personname> having made some truly spectacular saves some by the very tips of his gloves and <personname> having scored four of gryffindors six goals
this effectively stopped zacharias wondering loudly whether the two <personname>s were only there because <personname> liked them and he started on peakes and coote instead
how much did <personname> pay you to come on instead of him
wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the snitch held high in his hand
cmon <personname> demelza <personname> and <personname> were the last two in the changing room
she took a deep breath
demanded <personname>
you did it all yourself
i am sick of <personname> at the moment i do not know what i am supposed to have done
she asked smirking
crookshanks trotted after her his yellow eyes fixed upon arnold
er  does he
to <personname>s horror <personname> came in laughing pulling <personname> by the hand
oh he said drawing up short at the sight of <personname> and <personname>
there was a horrible swelling billowing silence
<personname> spun around to see <personname> pointing her wand at <personname> her expression wild the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward <personname> who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach
<personname> whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from <personname>s bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone
i never promised <personname> anything <personname> mumbled
i went into the girls bathroom just before i came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that romilda vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion
look sighed <personname> secrecy sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms do not they
but something that is just been put in the wrong bottle would not register and anyway love potions are not dark or dangerous  easy for you to say muttered <personname> thinking of romilda vane
fancy a gillywater
well take these anyway said romilda thrusting a box into his hands
he finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls bathroom on the floor below
did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow
he says very funny things sometimes does not he
a bit lonely without the da <personname>s been nice though
we are supposed to bring guests so i thought you might like  i mean  he was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear
potty asked loony to go to the partyl potty lurves loony  potty luuuuurves looooooonyv and he zoomed away cackling and shrieking potty loves loony nice to keep these things private said <personname>
muttered <personname>
what did you have to imitate her for
how are you
i would love to go though it sounds like it is going to be really good
wow you like your quidditch players do not you
at once <personname> and parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about mclaggen and all they had ever guessed about <personname>
she was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice
worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed <personname>s hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded
my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea  i am definitely not interested said <personname> firmly and i have just seen a friend of mine sorry
i debated for a while about zacharias smith but i thought on the whole   you considered smith
<personname> could smell cooking sherry again
is that all boys care about
no sorry said <personname> and he turned quickly to join in <personname>s conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking
said <personname> quietly his eyes still boring into <personname> who felt a certain disquiet
the last thing he wanted was for <personname> to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at potions
the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that
it is christmas and it is not a crime to want to come to a party
i did know your grandfather after all
i made the unbreakable vow draco  looks like you 11 have to break it then because i do not need your protection it is my job he gave it to me and i am doing it i have got a plan and it is going to work it is just taking a bit longer than i thought it would what is your plan
where do you think i would have been all these years if i had not known how to act
<personname> remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing
if you ask that once more said <personname> i am going to stick this sprout  i am only checking said <personname>
well you cannot break an unbreakable vow
aaah george look at this
everyone should be comfortable
i promised <personname> i would not wander off while i am staying here
that was the whole point he was refusing to tell <personname>
they did not hear him said <personname> flatly
<personname> turned to face him frowning
do you remember <personname>
has it been busy at the ministry
very said mr <personname>
i checked <personname> said mr <personname> at once
it is <personname>s business
<personname> trusts <personname> and that ought to be good enough for all of us
it comes down to whether or not you trust <personname>s judgment
the news would have leaked out anyway
nearly all of them are on <personname>s side
i bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins stealing and sometimes killing to eat
and it is hard to argue with grey back out there
said <personname> astonished
he plans it all
but you are normal said <personname> fiercely
<personname> meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking <personname>
<personname> and <personname> climbed all the way up to <personname>s attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for <personname>
feeling disappointed <personname> threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and <personname> stan shunpike and the half-blood prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children
you should definitely wear it in front of <personname> and george
said <personname> grinning
he hesitated a moment then said is <personname> really going out with mclaggen
they were at slughorns party together but i do not think it went that well
gravy <personname>
no i have not been in contact with anybody very much said <personname>
<personname>s patronus has changed its form he told him
why would your patronus change
<personname> said mrs <personname> suddenly
mr <personname> looked around
<personname> he is he is with the minister and sure enough the man <personname> had seen in the daily prophet was following along in <personname>s wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow
but <personname> showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family
oh perce said mrs <personname> tearfully reaching up to kiss him
no said <personname> truthfully
especially what happened at the ministry he waited for <personname> to say something but <personname> did not oblige so he went on i have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since i gained office but <personname> has most understandably as i say prevented this
<personname> could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron
i do not really know what you mean minister
people believe you are the <personname>sen one you see said scrimgeour
<personname> felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so <personname> <personname> was still at the ministry was she
either we have got <personname> pretending everythings lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or we have got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you have got the <personname>sen one working for you so you are not the <personname>sen one
i thought you said it did not matter either way
no i would not said <personname>
be good then all of you
she barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate
<personname> straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as <personname> came spinning into view
she and her friend violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the charms corridor
coming <personname>
well yes said <personname>
and he is acting on <personname>s orders just like i said hmm  did either of them actually mention <personname>s name
he told borgin that grey back was an old family friend and that he would be checking up on borgins progress <personname> gaped at her
<personname> failed though did not he
how cool will it be when we can just  <personname> clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance
behind <personname> fawkes the phoenix let out a low soft musical cry
i am very touched <personname>
scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you are not at hogwarts said <personname> still looking fixedly at his knees
yes he is very nosy about that said <personname> now sounding cheerful and <personname> thought it safe to look up again
amusing really
not of great importance
what was going on
let us say that i did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy said <personname>
as you know <personname> was wrongly accused of that crime
i have not been able to find many memories of <personname> at hogwarts said <personname> placing his withered hand on the pensieve
this is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there
as you will understand when we have experienced it
<personname> spoke in parseltongue
you look right like him
now he moved a little closer and said <personname> came back
he handed over his wand which was proved at once to have been used to kill the <personname>s
and he permitted himself to be led off to azkaban without a fight
his was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys
sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring
the whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that <personname> could see nothing but the face of <personname> who was standing beside him
<personname> i want your essay by tomorrow or it is detention
<personname> could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with slughorn
that is all there is
repeated <personname> sitting back down too
it will be your job to persuade professor slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all
<personname> stared at him
so good luck  and good night
i would not expect you to phineas replied <personname> and fawkes gave another low musical cry
birthday surprises the next day <personname> confided in both <personname> and <personname> the task that <personname> had set him though separately for <personname> still refused to remain in <personname>s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look
horcruxes  horcruxes  i have never even heard of them
<personname> was disappointed he had hoped that <personname> might have been able to give him a clue as to what horcruxes were
i think it is going to be difficult to get the information <personname> you will have to be very careful about how you approach slughorn think out a strategy
<personname> reckons i should just hang back after potions this afternoon
he glanced around at <personname> who was now standing there looking rather gormless having copied everything <personname> had done
you sure the prince has not got any tips
apparently the prince like <personname> had had no difficulty understanding it
nothing said <personname> gloomily
well let us see how you have done blaise  what have you got for me
slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds
and you thought of a bezoar all by yourself did you <personname>
she asked through gritted teeth
neither <personname> nor <personname> wished him luck as they left both looked rather annoyed
has not he
yes of course said slughorn quietly still dabbing at his white face
when <personname> did not question slughorn again the potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him and appeared to have put the matter from his mind
unfortunately however no such invitation arrived
rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of professors <personname> <personname> flitwick and sprout the heads of houses and a small wizard whom <personname> took to be the apparition instructor from the ministry
<personname> shot at him oblivious to <personname> standing right behind him
the second attempt was no better than the first
determination
how did you do
within five minutes they were climbing through the portrait hole
asked <personname> panting slightly
up here said <personname> and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys staircase
he had found it a folded square of apparently blank parchment which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand
this was most mysterious
he could only suppose that he was missing <personname> amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map
where was <personname>
want one
it is not that <personname> sighed again
you  you would not understand
what
<personname> was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick
they stared at each other for almost a whole minute before <personname> said this is a joke right
i think  <personname> i think i love her said <personname> in a strangled voice
okay said <personname> walking up to <personname> to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion okay say that again with a straight face
drop it
what was that for
you insulted her <personname> you said it was a joke shouted <personname> who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head
this is insane said <personname>
and then he saw the box lying open on <personname>s bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll
but on the other hand they were supposed to be friends <personname> had not been himself when he had attacked and <personname> thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted <personname> to declare undying love for romilda vane
that would explain a lot panted <personname> now positively wrestling with <personname> to keep him from knocking slughorn over
i have got butterbeer i have got wine i have got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead  hmm  meant to give that to <personname> for christmas  ah well  he shrugged
nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love
<personname> gave a great shudder a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still
a hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good it will do us if you lot are not allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore
lucky there was one in the room said <personname> who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone
yes said <personname> at once he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again
the poison could have been in the bottle in which case it was probably meant for slughorn himself
<personname> reckons <personname> wanted slughorn on his side said <personname>
<personname>s worse i bin readin to him didn get up ter dinner till jus now an then professor sprout told me abou <personname> how is he
it is terrible growled <personname> into his beard as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase
i never said tha said <personname> though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway
an then he said summat abou <personname> makin investigations in his house in slytherin
they are with me aren they
in spite of all he had told <personname> in spite of his insistence that he trusted <personname> completely he had lost his temper with him
oh  right  quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair
yeah  he might not make it
<personname> going to look in before the match
he hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it
the silent seconds trickled past and <personname> remained where he was frozen gazing at the place where <personname> had vanished
there was little wind the clouds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight
just get up by the goal posts once mclaggen had marched off <personname> turned to coote and peakes
smith was being quite rude about gryffindor i expect he regrets that now he is playing them oh look he is lost the quaffle <personname> took it from him i do like her she is very nice
i do not think that will help him find the snitch but maybe it is a clever ruse
said <personname> vaguely
you should not overexert yourself for a few hours
she bustled back into her office and <personname> sank back into his pillows fuming
dyou know how much we lost by
brilliant said <personname> savagely
if only he had rufus scrimgeours power he would have been able to set a tail upon <personname> but unfortunately <personname> did not have an office full of aurors at his command
it was easiest to feign sleep <personname> rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand
kreacher
i was watching that potty he told <personname> indignantly pointing at the fight below before letting out a loud cackle
master called me
kreacher will do whatever master wants said kreacher sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes because kreacher has no choice but kreacher is ashamed to have such a master yes <personname> will do it <personname> squeaked <personname> his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears
i want you to follow him around the clock
that is settled then said <personname>
never mind her said <personname> a little impatiently
asked <personname> giving <personname> a sharp look
but they said you would left
<personname> was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous
between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle
we have much more important matters to discuss
what with apparition lessons and quidditch and <personname> being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what <personname> was up to <personname> had almost forgotten about the memory <personname> had asked him to extract from professor slughorn
yes sir
thus far as i hope you agree i have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what <personname> did until the age of seventeen
he wanted to stay here
which job did he want sir
what subject did he want to teach
<personname> got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them
now how are you
i want to show mr <personname> our finest treasure
a badger murmured <personname> examining the engraving upon the cup
she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box
he had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society <personname> had set up spew precisely said <personname>
there were other reasons i think
the one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge
will not you sit down
they do not call me <personname> anymore he said
nevertheless <personname> felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly <personname>s refusal to use <personname>s chosen name was a refusal to allow <personname> to dictate the terms of the meeting and <personname> could tell that <personname> took it as such
<personname> inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine
i think you must know that i have seen and done much since i left this place
<personname> raised his eyebrows
i am glad to hear that you consider them friends said <personname>
nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose
i wish i could
why
i have ideas said <personname> but no more than that
<personname> was still burning with curiosity and even though <personname> had walked to the door and was holding it open for him he did not move at once
but the more i hint i want to finish it the tighter she holds on
<personname> appeared alongside kreacher his tea-cozy hat askew
asked <personname> still looking shocked by these sudden appearances
has he been going anywhere he should not have
i think it will be part of the magic of the room said <personname>
no it is not said <personname> at once
you would not think he would trust lots of them to know what he is doing
it is obvious is not it
he could have nicked some any time during that lesson
those two girls i saw him with when he missed quidditch ha <personname> and <personname> do you mean to say said <personname> in a hushed voice that that little girl whose scales i repaired
what dyou think
<personname> was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with <personname> inside it or out but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of <personname> or <personname> pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl
the stone remained solid and unyielding
before we start i want your dementor essays said <personname> waving his wand carelessly so that twenty five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk
the inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a dark wizards spells
well what <personname> said is the most useful if we are trying to tell them apart said <personname>
i would expect nothing more sophisticated from you <personname>ald <personname> the boy so solid he cannot apparate half an inch across a room
ivo whispered <personname> grabbing <personname>s arm as he opened his mouth furiously
then if you are still not you know as good as you would like to be you can postpone the test do it with me over the summ <personname> this is the boys bathroom the ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glasses
i have learned not to expect too much from boys
i came and saw you in your bath once remember
maybe if you two left he would come back again
never you mind said <personname> her small leaky eyes fixed on <personname> who was now definitely grinning
and so the following weekend <personname> joined <personname> and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight
the short queue of people waiting to file past <personname> who was doing his usual prodding act with the secrecy sensor moved forward a few steps and <personname> did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker
as it was sunday morning nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms the gryffindors in one tower the ravenclaws in another the slytherins in the dungeons and the hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens
yet this hopeful mood did not last long
he spun around one-legged and toppled over
what did you want to see him about
what
i do not know said <personname> shrugging but she was nearly crying when i mentioned his name  and her patronus is a big four-legged thing now
it is a thought said <personname> slowly
but i still do not know why she would be bursting into the castle to see <personname> if that is really why she was here
after the burial patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets but these signs of approaching summer did not lift <personname>s mood
said the girl
it would mean a lot to me if you would nip down for the burial later this evening
felix felicis
he said
<personname> did not answer
cool said <personname> peering over <personname>s shoulder to check
it is all about stopping <personname> is not it
it could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time
euphoria i take it
and <personname>
like you cannot do anything wrong
same difference really  as they had only just seen slughorn enter the great hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals they lingered for a while in the common room the plan being that <personname> should go to slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there
really excellent
this is felix felicis i suppose
as he did so he brushed accidentally against <personname>
that enough for you
how did you get out of the castle
i will be reporting that man he is more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me
well i cannot promise that he said gruffly
slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than <personname> now
and now <personname> saw clearly what was to be done
he had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish and his eyes were puffy red and swollen
<personname> patted him consolingly on the elbow which was the highest point of <personname> he could easily reach
he asked
not in trouble are you
said <personname> looking up alarmed
i have never really had a lot ter do with horace slughorn before
i have already dug the you know grave
there was a knock on the door and he turned to answer it blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so
would not have dreamed of it said slughorn
the three of them stepped out into the back garden
magnificent said slughorn approaching the spiders head where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge curved pincers shone motionless in the moonlight
there there said slughorn waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound
<personname> saw in his minds eye the expression on <personname>s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves and decided never to mention it to her
one for <personname>  said slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mugs  and one for me
sweet said slughorn
they laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two which was sad
oh said slughorn repressing a large belch
no well i was only one when they died said <personname> his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in <personname>s heavy snores
yeah  <personname> murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum said <personname>
it is is not it
but you will not help her son said <personname>
the potions master seemed unable to look away
i have to kill him
i am ashamed of what of what that memory shows
horcruxes <personname> could feel the felix felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle
the front door had remained unlocked for him but on the third floor he met peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts
i have got the memory from slughorn
<personname> this is spectacular news very well done indeed i knew you could do it all thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with slughorns memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the pensieve
<personname> <personname> if i knew i could not tell you said slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at <personname> though winking at the same time
sir i wondered what you know about  about horcruxes
i mean a wizard like you sorry i mean if you cannot tell me obviously i just knew if anyone could tell me you could so i just thought i would ask  it was very well done thought <personname> the hesitancy the casual tone the careful flattery none of it overdone
just so that you understand the term
few would want it <personname> very few
by committing murder
no sir of course not said <personname> quickly
thank you <personname> said <personname> quietly
asked <personname>
a mere memory starting to act and think for itself
quite correct said <personname> nodding
he was referring to his horcruxes horcruxes in the plural <personname> which i do not believe any other wizard has ever had
said <personname>
but they could be anywhere in the world hidden buried or invisible  i am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem said <personname> calmly
it seems that once <personname> had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it he did not want to wear it anymore
said <personname>
you are thinking of portkeys <personname> which must be ordinary objects easy to overlook
said <personname>
said <personname>
after an interval of some years however he used nagini to kill an old muggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last horcrux
i can
it was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once
when <personname> discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers i am told that his anger was terrible to behold
i understand that <personname> had told him the diary would because the chamber of secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted
you are still too young to understand how unusual you are <personname>
you have flitted into <personname>s mind without damage to yourself but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony as he discovered in the ministry
think <personname> watched <personname> striding up and down in front of him and thought
he thought of <personname>
of course you would cried <personname>
in other words you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy but <personname> continues to set store by the prophecy
they were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of slughorn and positively awed when he told them about <personname>s horcruxes and <personname>s promise to take <personname> along should he find another one
<personname> you are making it snow said <personname> patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flakes had started to fall
<personname> glanced over at dean on the other side of the classroom
what dyou mean
<personname> seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with <personname> and <personname> seemed cheery too though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said it is a nice day
no said katie shaking her head ruefully
that would be a complete waste of potion said <personname> flatly putting down the copy of spellmans syllabary she had just taken out of her bag
luck can only get you so far <personname>
and to complicate matters he had the nagging worry that if he did not do it somebody else was sure to ask <personname> out soon he and <personname> were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good
instinctively <personname> pulled out his own
now the wounds seemed to be knitting
it did not occur to <personname> for a second to disobey
most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past
i need a place to hide my book
i need a place to hide my book
he paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter
one by one <personname> extracted <personname>s books and examined them
your nickname repeated <personname>
i understand what a nickname is said <personname>
the news had traveled very fast apparently <personname> had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story <personname> had already been visited in the hospital wing by pansy parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying <personname> far and wide and <personname> had told the staff precisely what had happened
<personname> had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of professor <personname> who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly <personname> s punishment of detention every saturday until the end of term
biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him
it seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock perhaps <personname> had bewitched it to go extra slowly
then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling
<personname> looked over the top of <personname>s head to see dean thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and romilda vane looking as though she might throw something
after all it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of dark magic
<personname> and <personname> both roared with laughter
yeah i would said <personname> grudgingly
but <personname>s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into june for <personname> and <personname>s time together was becoming increasingly restricted
but <personname> was sure that <personname> had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the princes book and was determined to leave it where it was while <personname> remained on the lookout
now i have been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing dark spells  he did not make a hobby of it  he he who says it is a he
well why not
no listen if say her father was a wizard whose surname was prince and her mother was a muggle then that would make her a half-blood prince yeah very ingenious <personname>  but it would maybe she was proud of being half a prince listen <personname> i can tell it is not a girl
he stopped in his tracks listening
how dare you aaaaargh the noise was coming from a corridor nearby <personname> sprinted toward it his wand at the ready hurtled around another corner and saw professor trelawney sprawled upon the floor her head covered in one of her many shawls several sherry bottles lying beside her one broken
some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses
and then
no i did not as i say it was pitch  she stopped and glared at him suspiciously
to his surprise professor trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion looking haughty
if <personname> chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show  her bony hand closed suddenly around <personname>s wrist
we could go together
i miss having you in my classes <personname> she said soulfully as they set off together
you were never much of a seer  but you were a wonderful object <personname> did not reply he had loathed being the object of professor trelawneys continual predictions of doom
yes there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with <personname> who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs although i am afraid that i myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with <personname> you see he himself was seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tips well after that you know <personname> seemed much more disposed to give me a job and i could not help thinking <personname> that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes <personname> dear
she repeated uncertainly
it is natural to be afraid said <personname>
boiling with anger at <personname> his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes
what has upset you
i believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned  but he is a very good occlumens is not he sir
said <personname> whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady
i have told you my views
you are leaving the school tonight and i will bet you have not even considered that <personname> and <personname> might decide to  to what
professor trelawney was just in the room of requirement trying to hide her sherry bottles and she heard <personname> whooping celebrating he is trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he is fixed it at last and you are about to just walk out of school without  enough said <personname>
please do not suggest that i do not take the safety of my students seriously <personname>
i mean that you must follow even such orders as run hide or go back
what does he want
listen
<personname>  began <personname> her eyes huge with fear
say good-bye to her for me
and he was off hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall
you can apparate now i believe
no matter said <personname> i can assist you again
he glanced over his shoulder
not here precisely said <personname>
and with the sudden agility of a much younger man <personname> slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward the dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth
<personname> pulled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed
<personname> approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that <personname> did not understand
what is it professor
blood if i am not much mistaken
blood
the darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness
he set off around the edge of the lake and <personname> followed close behind him
their footsteps made echoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water
he said finally
only if we are very unfortunate
magic always leaves traces said <personname> as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive traces
thus far however we have done well
i rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it
<personname> stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor
nearly there said <personname> cheerfully
sure enough the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last and within minutes the boat had come to a halt bumping gently into something that <personname> could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake
you try
you think the horcrux is in there sir
<personname> saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion
no yes i think so only by drinking it can i empty the basin and see what lies in its depths
sir said <personname> trying to keep his voice reasonable sir this is <personname> we are  i am sorry <personname> i should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island <personname> corrected himself
undoubtedly he said finally this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the horcrux
this being the case <personname> it will be your job to make sure i keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth
but what if
but   your word <personname>
he said anxiously as <personname> lowered the empty glass
<personname> reached forward and grasped the crystal cup holding it steady
no  he groaned as <personname> lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him
i do not want to
it is all my fault all my fault he sobbed
no shouted <personname> who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down beside <personname> and heaved him over onto his back <personname>s glasses were askew his mouth agape his eyes closed
sir are you
still slashing at the air with his wand <personname> yelled  sectumsempral sectumsempral but though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin they had no blood to spill they walked on unfeeling their shrunken hands outstretched toward him and as he backed away still farther he felt arms enclose him from behind thin fleshless arms cold as death and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him slowly and surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of <personname>s shattered soul
<personname> seized him and helped him back to his seat
do not talk now said <personname> fearing how slurred <personname>s voice had become how much his feet dragged
the lightning-struck tower once back under the starry sky <personname> heaved <personname> onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet
for one horrible moment <personname>s imagination showed him more inferi creeping toward him around the sides of shops but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring all was still the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows
madam pomfrey  no said <personname>
<personname> raised his wand at once
how long had they been away
as they flew over the dark twisting lane down which they had walked earlier <personname> heard over the whistling of the night air in his ears <personname> muttering in some strange language again
what does it mean
tell him what has happened and bring him to me
who else is here
right under your nose and you never realized ingenious said <personname>
there was silence
draco draco you are not a killer
i have been working on it all year and tonight  somewhere in the depths of the castle below <personname> heard a muffled yell
somebody is putting up a good fight said <personname> conversationally
but <personname> said nothing he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as <personname> was
killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe
then as though he could not help himself he said i had to mend that broken vanishing cabinet that no ones used for years
in borgin and burkes said <personname> and they make a kind of passage between them
yeah said <personname> who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from <personname>s praise
sneered <personname> as <personname> slid a little down the ramparts the strength in his legs apparently fading and <personname> struggled fruitlessly mutely against the enchantment binding him
professor <personname> has been keeping watch over you on my orders  he has not been doing your orders he promised my mother  of course that is what he would tell you draco but he is a double agent you stupid old man he is not working for you you just think he is we must agree to differ on that draco
but you must have had an accomplice all the same  someone in hogsmeade someone who was able to slip katie the the aaaah  <personname> closed his eyes again and nodded as though he was about to fall asleep
got there at last have you
there was another yell from below rather louder than the last
<personname> gave a harsh laugh
you knew that i had left the school
someone is dead said <personname> and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it
yes they do that said <personname>
no harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived
<personname> wandless <personname> alone well done draco well done good evening amycus said <personname> calmly as though welcoming the man to a tea party
and you have brought alecto too
think your little jokesll help you on your deathbed then
this is most unusual
that is right said fenrir greyback
<personname> was showing less resolution than ever
always the same were not you dumby talking and doing nothing nothing
the three death eaters fell back without a word
he saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing who ran screeching into neighboring paintings
shouted <personname>
<personname> belongs to the dark <personname> we are to leave him go go and <personname> felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous death eater obeyed running toward the gates
it was i who invented them i the half-blood prince and you would turn my inventions on me like your filthy father would you
<personname>
<personname> could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt fangs reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him
<personname>  i was bindin up a couple of bowtruckle legs when i heard  them cornin said <personname> sadly still staring at his wrecked cabin
<personname> said <personname>
<personname> reached out straightened the half moon spectacles upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve
after what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down
moreover there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been
rab <personname> neither knew nor cared what the message meant
madam pomfrey says he will not will not look the same anymore
pushing open the doors <personname> saw <personname> lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door
are you all right <personname>
<personname> looked over <personname>s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on <personname>s pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque
where is he
he turned away and caught <personname>s eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what <personname> had said
how did he die
nobody paid her any attention except <personname> who whispered shh listen gulping madam pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth her eyes wide
<personname> and <personname> are on their way she said and the spell of the music was broken everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances turning again to look at <personname> or else to rub their own eyes shake their heads
<personname> was a highly accomplished occlumens said <personname> his voice uncharacteristically harsh
we always knew that
i always thought <personname> must know something about <personname> that we did not
<personname> believed <personname> was sorry <personname> was dead
<personname> had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case  <personname> <personname> and <personname> were to join us  and so we patrolled
obviously <personname> could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them but we did not dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other and by the time we would reached a corridor that was light they would gone
we hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened
i was so stupid <personname> said <personname> in a high pitched whisper
<personname> ran at it and got thrown up into the air  none of us could break through said <personname> and that massive death eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us
he must have known a spell we did not whispered <personname>
after all he was the defense against the dark arts teacher
so what does that mean
mrs <personname> took the nasty-smelling ointment from madam pomfrey and began dabbing at <personname>s wounds
<personname> is it true  is he really
or peraps you hoped
she is very fond of <personname> you know and it would look lovely with your hair
thank you said <personname> stiffly
<personname> will not be a full werewolf
i would like you to join us too
the corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song
in fact it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and <personname> had left it mere hours previously the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables gryffindors sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight the sorting hat on a shelf behind the desk
after glancing once at this portrait professor <personname> made an odd movement as though steeling herself then rounded the desk to look at <personname> her face taut and lined
<personname> <personname> registered the renewed use of his surname in the light of professor <personname>s death i think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat i do not think so said <personname> shrugging
but  there is one thing you should know before the ministry gets here though
it is horrible
we must follow the established procedures
said <personname> fiercely
well said squeaked professor flitwick
no said <personname>
someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place
do not know said <personname> lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards
so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said <personname> happily plumping up <personname>s pillows because ze british overcook their meat i ave always said this
<personname> i found something out this morning in the library
rab
no no <personname> i did not mean that she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard
he would play up the pure blood side so he could get in with <personname> and the rest of them
i still do not get why he did not turn you in for using that book said <personname>
professor <personname> had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once
please follow your heads of houses out into the grounds
they filed out from behind their benches in near silence
the warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed professor <personname> in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows
<personname> could see scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with professor <personname>
<personname> seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table
white smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes <personname> thought for one heart stopping moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished
<personname> s face was glazed with tears but <personname> was no longer crying
we have got to stop seeing each other
but i cannot  we cannot  i have got things to do alone now
he will try and get to me through you
she looked away from him over the lake
<personname> told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because i never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember
well  i cannot say i am surprised
<personname> he saw was now holding <personname> and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dripping from the end of his own long nose
moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the horcruxes and kill <personname> would feel better than waiting to do it
i cannot tell you how appalled i was to hear of it
<personname> repeated coming to a halt
scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at <personname> his expression shrewd now
he will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him said <personname> smiling in spite of himself
my dear boy  even <personname> cannot return from the  i am not saying he can
that is right
what dyou reckon <personname>
then i have got to track down the rest of the horcruxes have not i
