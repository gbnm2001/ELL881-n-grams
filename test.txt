he got into his car and backed out of number fours drive
but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else
it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying
he did not blame her if he would had a sister like that  but all the same those people in cloaks  he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five of the clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door
mr <personname> sat frozen in his armchair
while mrs <personname> was in the bathroom mr <personname> crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden
was he imagining things
he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high-heeled buckled boots
he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket
you would think they would be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something is going on
about what finally stopped him
what they are saying she pressed on is that last night <personname> turned up in godrics hollow
it is it is true
he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide
hell have that scar forever
shhh hissed professor <personname> you will wake the muggles s-s-sorry sobbed <personname> taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it
he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four
are you up yet
she demanded
<personname>s favorite punching bag was <personname> but he could not often catch him
that is two less than last year
<personname> thought for a moment
dinky duddydums do not cry mummy will not let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him
the snake jerked its head toward uncle <personname> and <personname> then raised its eyes to the ceiling
<personname> peered at it
the zoo director himself made aunt <personname> a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again
as far as <personname> had seen the snake had not done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle <personname>s car <personname> was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death
<personname> lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch
he would lived with the <personname>s almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he would been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash
it turned out she would broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she did not seem quite as fond of them as before
three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle <personname>s sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for <personname>
the <personname>s house had four bedrooms one for uncle <personname> and aunt <personname> one for visitors usually uncle <personname>s sister marge one where <personname> slept and one where <personname> kept all the toys and things that would not fit into his first bedroom
as they could not go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom
uncle <personname> stayed at home again
i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave
<personname> asked aunt <personname> dully late that afternoon
i warn you i am armed there was a pause
<personname> looked up at the giant
soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage
now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet
but <personname> simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean
where was i
how could a car crash kill <personname> an <personname>
it is an outrage a scandal <personname> not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why
he looked suddenly anxious
as bad as you could go
nah cannot spell it
no one ever lived after he decided ter kill  them no one except you an he would killed some of the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived
brought you ter this lot  load of old tosh said uncle <personname>
<personname> looked into the fire
although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight
<personname> yawned loudly sat up and stretched
the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight
<personname> took the parchment envelope out of his pocket
the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent
p-p-<personname> stammered professor quirrell grasping <personname>s hand c-cannot t-tell you how p-pleased i am to meet you
at last <personname> managed to make himself heard over the babble
poor bloke
<personname> looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall
gringotts said <personname>
<personname>s trusted me
the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook was not steering
stalagmites got an m in it said <personname>
a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared <personname> gasped
inside were mounds of gold coins
vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly
i think he is brilliant said <personname> coldly
not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago you would be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze
just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and you got to have the best wand
a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside
it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that <personname> sat on to wait
<personname>
it was not a question
the wand chooses the wizard remember
how can they expect great things
er uncle <personname>
i just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven of the clock he read
taking <personname> to the hospital growled uncle <personname>
uncle <personname> dumped <personname>s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him
<personname> turned and saw the <personname>s drive away
now what is the platform number
i am not <personname> i am george said the boy
er okay said <personname>
he passed a round-faced boy who was saying gran i have lost my toad again
a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd
want a hand
yes please <personname> panted
said one of the twins suddenly pointing at <personname>s lightning scar
<personname> chorused the twins
george
mom geroff
he wriggled free
hang on i think i remember him saying something about it said the other twin
you have already seen him <personname> and the poor boy is not something you goggle at in a zoo
<personname> saw he still had a black mark on his nose
yes said <personname> but i cannot remember it
nothing
his names scabbers and he is useless he hardly ever wakes up
no said <personname>
can i have a frog
he is gone well you cannot expect him to hang around all day said <personname>
has anyone seen a toad
we have already told him we have not seen it said <personname> but the girl was not listening she was looking at the wand in his hand
i do not know what they will say if i am not
<personname> was wondering what a wizard did once he would finished school
<personname> turned this news over in his mind
he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time <personname> was mentioned
three boys entered and <personname> recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop
<personname> peered out of the window
oy you there is this your toad
7 the sorting hat the door swung open at once
she had a very stern face and <personname>s first thought was that this was not someone to cross
she pulled the door wide
you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room
what the
the sorting ceremonys about to start
dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver
i read about it in hogwarts a history
finch-fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes <personname> noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide
he could see the high table properly now
<personname>s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts
the others laughed
<personname> s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the <personname> twins
<personname> directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another
people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring
then there were doors that would not open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that were not really doors at all but solid walls just pretending
three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for
professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk
she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls
i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you are not as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach
hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day
where was it now
he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke
scowling <personname> quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table
at three-thirty that afternoon <personname> <personname> and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson
it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance
come on dear
ooh sticking up for <personname>
professor <personname> slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys
your father would have been proud she said
he said
i tell you we are going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said <personname>
you must be good <personname> wood was almost skipping when he told us
having a last meal <personname>
wizards duel
what is the matter
<personname> he said
and it is really none of your business said <personname>
dyou think i am going to stand out here and wait for <personname> to catch me
<personname> had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it was not <personname>
oh move over <personname> snarled
they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs
the dog was guarding something
he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm
<personname> looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put <personname> out of their minds
the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start-of-term banquet
the troll did not even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward <personname> instead giving <personname> time to run around it
the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble
why are not you in your dormitory
<personname> stuck his wand up its nose and <personname> knocked it out with its own club
i am very disappointed in you
they hurried out of the chamber and did not speak at all until they had climbed two floors up
but from that moment on <personname> became their friend
he did not know how he would have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do
the day before <personname>s first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar
library books are not to be taken outside the school said <personname>
perhaps <personname> had left the book in there
did you get it
his heart skipped
flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i am sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession
it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him
he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand
reaching <personname> she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well-chosen words
it bit him
we think he was trying to steal whatever it is guarding
<personname> looked furious with himself
<personname> and <personname> chuckled
move along all of you
and that reminds me <personname> <personname> we have got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library
go on out wishing he would been a bit quicker at thinking up some story <personname> left the library
and you could ask your parents if they know who <personname> is said <personname>
said <personname> turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than <personname>s
my mom
i told her you did not expect any presents and oh no he groaned she is made you a <personname> sweater
if that is what i think it is they are really rare and really valuable
i suppose she thinks you do not forget your name
christmas is a time for family
he had to start somewhere
panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it
it looked like an unused classroom
she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine <personname> thought edging a little closer to the glass
it is here just here yes they pushed the door open
there they were
see
what if they walk into you
<personname> must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he had not noticed him
then he said slowly it shows us what we want  whatever we want  yes and no said <personname> quietly
ni<personname>las flambl <personname> had convinced <personname> not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk
there is not a reserve seeker
dyou want the card you collect them do not you
<personname> and <personname> barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms
i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet
see
i have never seen <personname> look so mean he told <personname>
he followed
and i gave <personname> a black eye and <personname> tried to take on <personname> and <personname> single handed he is still out cold but madam pomfrey says he will be all right talk about showing slytherin everyone is waiting for you in the common room we are having a party <personname> and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens
it will be gone by next tuesday said <personname>
unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as <personname>
so what on earths <personname> up to
yeah yer not still on abou that are you
look <personname> helped protect the stone he is not about ter steal it
he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past <personname>
keep the egg in the fire because their mothers breathe on  them see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket of brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour
a couple of sparks flew out of its snout
it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs
it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief
the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle
the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs
that put gryffindor in last place
what goodll that do
next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban
he strode out of sight <personname> did not think quirrell had even noticed him
quirrells too scared to back us up
the following morning notes were delivered to <personname> <personname> and <personname> at the breakfast table
hurry up i want ter get started
we cannot go in there at night there is all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard
said <personname> his voice cracking with glee
there is blood all over the place it must have bin staggerin around since last night at least
a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and <personname> <personname> and <personname> took the left path while <personname> <personname> and fang took the right
we would noticed said <personname> faintly
never said <personname> irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur
said <personname>
you do not think they have been hurt do you
a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered
are you all right
what are you doing
do you realize who this is
what have you been telling him
centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that <personname> had to grab his shoulders to stay on
but who would be that desperate
over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what <personname> had told him on the night they had met some say he died
stop saying the name said <personname> in a terrified whisper as if he thought <personname> could hear them
well i suppose bane 11 be happy
with <personname> around <personname> will not touch you
anyway who says the centaurs are right
maybe it was because they had not seen what <personname> had seen in the forest or because they did not have scars burning on their foreheads but <personname> and <personname> did not seem as worried about the stone as <personname>
my scar keeps hurting it is happened before but never as often as this
no we are in a hurry
mighta come up said <personname> frowning as he tried to remember
so i told him <personname>s a piece of cake if you know how to calm him down jus play him a bit of music an he will go straight off ter sleep  <personname> suddenly looked horrified
<personname> <personname> and <personname> did not speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds
he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once
now
look said <personname> throwing caution to the winds professor it is about the sorcerers stone  whatever professor <personname> had expected it was not that
dyou think he will leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup
petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at <personname>
give the flute to <personname> so she can keep him asleep
there was no sign of the bottom
look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall
oh right said <personname> and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on <personname> at the plant
it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room
that one he called to the others
every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy
you have got to make some sacrifices i make my move and she will take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king <personname> but  do you want to stop <personname> or not
<personname>  look if you do not hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative
they had won
give me a minute
i am not as good as you said <personname> very embarrassed as she let go of him
me he said calmly
i see the stone  i am presenting it to my master  but where is it
<personname> screwed up his courage
it was a pair of glasses
the smiling face of <personname> swam into view above him
<personname> swallowed and looked around him
no doubt they thought it would amuse you
how long have i been in here
professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you
you got <personname>s owl
well <personname> and i have had a little chat and agreed it is all for the best
yes sir
he did not realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark
you let professor <personname> in
so the stones gone
please cheer up <personname> we saved the stone it is gone he cannot use it
have a <personname>colate frog i have got loads
<personname> <personname> and <personname> stood up to yell and cheer as <personname> white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him
in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place
it was the best evening of <personname>s life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls  he would never ever forget tonight
she is used to flying around outside
he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache
this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career said uncle <personname>
he would been talking of nothing else for two weeks
<personname> put on a foul simpering smile
right i am off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for <personname> and me
he said suspiciously
you c-cannot dad told you you are not to do m-magic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you have not got anywhere else to go you have not got any friends to take you   jiggery pokeryv  said <personname> in a fierce voice
<personname> said the creature in a high-pitched voice <personname> was sure would carry down the stairs
<personname> leaned toward <personname> his eyes wide as headlights
there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle <personname>s voice
one more sound and you will wish you would never been born boy he stomped flat-footed from the room
uncle <personname> might still have been able to make his deal if it had not been for the owl
mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics
<personname>s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him
<personname> was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair
out of the way <personname>
i have heard dad talking about him said george
we are a little way outside the village said george
so she said
there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and <personname> sat down on the edge of his seat looking around
books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts it is magid and unless <personname>s ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck
now let us see what lockharts got to say on the subject  and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece
this is what you have to do he said
he let go of the gnomes ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge
mr <personname>s eyes jerked open
well dear i think you will find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth
i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs <personname>s eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed
<personname>s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle
in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the <personname>s hedge
<personname> already knows you are here <personname> does not miss a trick that man
lockharts books are really expensive
wish i knew what he was up to said <personname> frowning
he and the next brother <personname> had already left hogwarts
how exactly  not now <personname> said mrs <personname>
you must speak clearly dear mrs <personname> told <personname> as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot
dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes
he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea
the sooner he got out of here the better
i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call
ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr <personname>s list and scurrying over to draco
he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr <personname> at the counter
muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room
i was lost floo powder  <personname> seized <personname> by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands
he tried to sidle back over to the <personname>s but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side
<personname> went as red as <personname>
they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs <personname> beside herself with fury
mr <personname> dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station
what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten
a dozen curious people were still watching them
how will they get home
this thought <personname> was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing <personname>s and georges jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle
steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood <personname> was shrieking in terror a golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on <personname>s head where he had hit the windshield and to his right <personname> let out a low despairing groan
what is happen
he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly
innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle
<personname> closed the door and turned to look at them
this was not the first time <personname> had given <personname> the impression of being able to read minds
skip the lecture said <personname> impatiently and tell us the new password
it looked quite ordinary to <personname> but <personname> and <personname> were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode
<personname> caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling
the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she said promptly
everyone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sprout
when i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completely covered said professor sprout
<personname> let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear
i cannot tell you how glad i am i came here instead
why demanded <personname> seizing her schedule have you outlined all lockharts lessons in little hearts
i am in gryffindor too
he said raising the camera hopefully
you are giving out signed photos <personname>
you could have fried an egg on your face said <personname>
know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here
they grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore pictures from the walls up-ended the waste basket grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half the class was sheltering under desks and <personname> was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling
he swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him
well the quaffle that is the biggish red one is the one that scores goals
yes said <personname> as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass
said wood testily
there were no girls on the slytherin team who stood shoulder to shoulder facing the gryffindors leering to a man
said <personname> smoothly
<personname> <personname> are you all right
what did lockhart want with you <personname>
<personname> asked scratching fangs ears
it was bad said <personname> hoarsely emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty
gettin on well are not they
what voice
what are you talking about <personname>
and then i had another slug attack all over a special award for services to the school
keeping his voice low so as not to wake <personname> dean and <personname> <personname> told <personname> exactly what he had heard
even aside from the rain and wind it had not been a happy practice session
they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles
it is only a bit of mud to you boy but to me it is an extra hour scrubbing shouted <personname> a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose
have you did you read
if i thought you would read my private not that it is mine for a friend be that as it may however <personname> was staring at him alarmed <personname> had never looked madder
he watched <personname> on tenterhooks
she haunts a toilet
bet he asked you to say that if i could have everyone is attention it is time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight
was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings did not matter
i smell blood his stomach lurched it is going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring <personname>s and <personname>s bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps <personname> hurtled around the whole of the second floor <personname> and <personname> panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage
said <personname> wiping sweat off his face
looc something was shining on the wall ahead
enemies of the heir beware
what is going on
the silent crowd parted to let them pass
if <personname> believed <personname> he would be expelled for sure
no second year could have done this said <personname> firmly
but i believe i am the potions master at this school
she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them
please sir do not legends always have a basis in fact
oh very well he said slowly
his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly
but <personname> who had already heard of slytherin houses reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin  and the hat had said oh well if you are sure  better be gryffindor
they looked at each other
feeling they had better get off the subject <personname> said remember all that water on the floor
no <personname> agreed
peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself
clues you know  <personname> swelled in a manner that reminded <personname> forcefully of mrs <personname>
his fathers definitely evil enough
but how do we prove it
said <personname> and <personname> together
i do not know if this is a good idea
there were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual
how long will it take to make anyway
but we have got better people on our brooms
through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear <personname> thought <personname> was attacking him
with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom
he saw a glitter of teeth
said <personname> through clenched teeth
it was still putting up a terrific fight
but it does not do anything else either
you nearly got <personname> and me expelled he said fiercely
<personname> gets them five times a day at home
he slumped back into bed his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer
and from what <personname> could see of professor <personname>s shadowy face she did not understand this any better than he did
we have decided this is the safest place to hide it
maybe it can make itself invisible said <personname> prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron
so <personname> stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm
<personname> prowled through the fumes making waspish remarks about the gryffindors work while the slytherins sniggered appreciatively
<personname>s potion exploded showering the whole class
anyone who has been splashed come here for a deflating draught when i find out who did this  <personname> tried not to laugh as he watched <personname> hurry forward his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon
he tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin
that was a disarming charm as you see i have lost my wand ah thank you miss <personname> yes an excellent idea to show them that professor <personname> but if you do not mind my saying so it was very obvious what you were about to do
he raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action and dropped it
<personname> raised his wand quickly and bellowed  serpensortial the end of his wand exploded
said <personname>
what is wrong with everyone
for heavens sake <personname> said <personname> exasperated as one of <personname>s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board
he could not see whether justin was among them
i did not chase it at him <personname> said his voice shaking with anger
<personname> found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet
that will do macmillan said professor <personname> sharply
before <personname> could speak another word however the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and <personname> burst in a wild look in his eyes his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand
he thought too about what everyone was saying about him and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with salazar slytherin
the polyjuice potions nearly ready
<personname> and <personname> had barely finished their third helpings of christmas pudding when <personname> ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening
once they are asleep pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet
she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me and she is gone home for christmas so i will just have to tell the slytherins i have decided to come back
when <personname> had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potion again <personname> turned to <personname> with a doom-laden expression
did you get them
one two three  pinching his nose <personname> drank the potion down in two large gulps
except that he looked pale and shocked <personname> was indistinguishable from <personname> from the pudding bowl haircut to the long gorilla arms
well get off to your dormitories said <personname> sternly
a voice suddenly echoed behind <personname> and <personname>
of course it was fifty years ago so it was before his time but he knows all about it and he says that it was all kept quiet and it will look suspicious if i know too much about it
what is up
it took a long time to persuade <personname> to leave the bathroom
wait till everyone finds out you have got a tail  v the very secret diary <personname> remained in the hospital wing for several weeks
said <personname>
there was not the faintest trace of writing on any of them not even auntie mabels birthday or dentist half-past three
on her first evening back in gryffindor tower <personname> showed her t
we know the person who opened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago
but <personname> was pulling her wand out of her bag
peeves was not helping matters he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh <personname> you rotter  now with a dance routine to match
his books wand parchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything
right he said sitting on <personname>s ankles
off you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to class now he said shooing some of the younger students away
this was partly because he did not think he could stand <personname> and george singing his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time and partly because he wanted to examine <personname>s diary again and knew that <personname> thought he was wasting his time
a silver prefects badge was glinting on his chest
the torches had not been lit and when <personname> pushed the door almost closed <personname> could only just see him standing stock-still by the door watching the passage outside
it felt to <personname> that they were there for at least an hour
it is all over he said
the dead girls parents will be here tomorrow
but he was equally certain that <personname> would never have meant to kill anybody
peeves had finally got bored of his oh <personname> you rotter song ernie macmillan asked <personname> quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in herbology one day and in march several of the mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three
play to your strengths <personname>
but his cheerful mood did not last long
someone is been looking for something said <personname>
<personname> started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk
they were found near the library said professor <personname>
i will escort you back to gryffindor tower said professor <personname> heavily
i have bin expectin doesn matter sit down i will make tea he hardly seemed to know what he was doing
<personname> checked that they were hidden seized his crossbow and flung open his door once more
he entered looking deadly serious and was followed by a second very odd looking man
got to be seen to be doing something
that remains to be seen said mr <personname> with a nasty smile
but as he was about to follow <personname> through the door he stopped again and said loudly an someonell need ter feed fang while i am away
help will always be given at hog warts to those who ask for it
<personname> was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy
<personname> and <personname> lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot
every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant
<personname> and george challenged <personname> and <personname> to a few games of exploding snap and <personname> sat watching them very subdued in <personname> s usual chair
when <personname> pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them
cmon fang we are going for a walk said <personname> patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree
then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and <personname>s wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path
the forests turned it wild
we have lost the trail he said
<personname> did not speak
<personname> it called
that is why we have come
<personname> thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he did not think his legs would support him
<personname> clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause did not usually make <personname> feel sick with fear
said <personname> who could feel cold sweat on his forehead
it would have been my instinct but out of respect for <personname> i never harmed a human
we do not name it i never even told <personname> the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times
<personname> spun around
the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield
the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster <personname> even other monsters did not want to name it
he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright
what if she never left the bathroom
the whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education she said sternly
<personname> looked as though he would just been told he had to go and live in the forbidden forest
it might be kinder to leave her where she is till they are over
<personname> suddenly realized who <personname> looked like
i have got to tell you something <personname> mumbled carefully not looking at <personname>
if you have finished eating i will take that seat <personname>
what were you doing <personname>
his hair was not as sleek as usual it seemed he had been up most of the night patrolling the fourth floor
<personname> smoothed it out eagerly and <personname> leaned close to read it too
it is because i understand parseltongue
<personname> had just realized the monster was a basilisk
a giant snake  someone would have seen  <personname> however pointed at the word <personname> had scribbled at the foot of the page
but the bell to signal break never came
d-did i
lockhart gazed desperately around him but nobody came to the rescue
anything
tell him what we know
his office had been almost completely stripped
robes jade green lilac midnight-blue had been hastily folded into one of them books were jumbled untidily into the other
no one regrets more than i  you are the defense against the dark arts teacher said <personname>
no it is been a lot of work <personname>
let us see he said
i think that is everything
ooooh it was dreadful she said with relish
well you hardly seem to need me said lockhart with a shadow of his old smile
their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight
<personname> turned back to look at the thing his heart beating so fast it hurt
next moment he was standing alone gazing at a solid wall of broken rock
he cleared his throat and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker
are you a ghost
<personname> lowered <personname> back onto the floor unable to hold her up any longer
he asked slowly
it had taken me five whole years to find out everything i could about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entrance  as though <personname> had the brains or the power only the transfiguration teacher <personname> seemed to think <personname> was innocent
there was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now
he pulled <personname>s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air writing three shimmering words tom marvolo riddle then he waved the wand once and the letters of his name rearranged themselves i am lord voldemort you see
how did you survive
i wondered you see
but was this dying
phoenix tears  said <personname> quietly staring at <personname>s arm
of course  healing powers  i forgot he looked into <personname>s face
shaking all over <personname> pulled himself up
<personname> oh <personname> i tried to tell you at b breakfast but i c -could not say it in front of <personname> it was me <personname> but i i s-swear i d-did not mean to r-<personname> made me he t-took me over and how did you kill that that thing
odd sort of place this is not it
you are alive she said blankly to <personname>
urgh said <personname> as they left the bathroom for the dark deserted corridor outside
<personname> it was mrs <personname> who had been sitting crying in front of the fire
never trust anything that can think for itself if you cannot see where it keeps its brain
professor <personname> <personname> said quickly there was an accident down in the chamber of secrets
suddenly something that was nagging at <personname> came tumbling out of his mouth
you happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his hand-picked students
i suggest you go down to the feast while i write to azkaban we need our gamekeeper back
mr <personname> said nothing
very fortunate the diary was discovered and <personname>s memories wiped from it
the quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph
these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that <personname> had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
while uncle <personname> aunt <personname> and <personname> had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle <personname>s new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too <personname> had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom
hello
i am a friend of <personname>s from s<personname>old  uncle <personname>s small eyes swiveled around to <personname> who was rooted to the spot
so <personname> had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one
he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets
<personname> was not worried about her she would been gone this long before
dear <personname> happy birthday look i am really sorry about that telephone call
inside this too there was a wrapped present a card and a letter this time from <personname>
i am really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating
will your aunt and uncle let you come
the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk
the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so <personname> threw it down on the bed and reached for <personname>s card
tell you when i see you
the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today  hang on barked uncle <personname> staring furiously at the reporter
<personname> whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump
aunt marge
<personname> smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television
i am not taking you he snarled as he turned to see <personname> watching him
then he went to <personname>s cage
a feeling of great gloom in his stomach <personname> pulled the door open
on the threshold stood aunt marge
oh i have got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge
<personname> was bursting to say that he would rather live in an orphanage than with the <personname>s but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him
st
oh yeah said <personname> loads of times
she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made <personname> such an unsatisfactory person
remember the form he told himself
he could not afford to let it happen again
just a small one then she chuckled
<personname> was eating his fourth slice of pie
but i do like to see a healthy-sized boy she went on winking at <personname>
then she ran off with a wastrel and here is the result right in front of us
he wriggled out seized <personname>s empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle <personname> burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters
i have had enough
if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic could not hurt
they belonged as <personname> saw when he raised his head to a triple-decker violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air
he had just caught sight of <personname> who was still sitting on the ground
ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha
he looked strangely familiar
broad daylight
<personname> prompted apologetically
there you are <personname> said a voice
i knew it stan shouted gleefully
bye <personname> called stan
<personname> smiled at <personname> over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew
and you are to be back here before dark each night
no no  best we know where you are
the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto <personname>s arm
<personname> met <personname> and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into the real <personname> <personname> a round-faced forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts
forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested
said <personname> rolling his eyes at <personname>
it is my rat he told the witch
well if you do not want a replacement you can try this rat tonic said the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle
said <personname> pompously shaking hands
it was rather like being introduced to the mayor
dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair
it is because of you perce said george seriously
why are the ministry providing cars father
i think i might have left it in the bar  you are not going anywhere till you have found my badge yelled <personname>
i suppose he knows about all this
<personname> waited until he heard mr and mrs <personname>s bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottle
<personname> forced a laugh went to give <personname> the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed
<personname> had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs <personname> obviously thought <personname> would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth
they are here he said
<personname> imitated him
there is something i have got to tell you before you leave  said mr <personname> in a tense voice
<personname> i knew you were well made of stronger stuff than <personname> seems to think and i am obviously pleased that you are not scared but  <personname> called mrs <personname> who was now shepherding the rest onto the train
go away <personname> said <personname>
<personname> <personname> and <personname> set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train
a faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere
no well  i was not supposed to be using errol
they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff
but if we are with him said <personname> spiritedly to <personname> <personname> would not dare  oh <personname> do not talk rubbish snapped <personname>
<personname>s already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street
the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks
so why are we stopping
it was inside his chest it was inside his very heart
but the dementor did not move so <personname> muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away
did you feel how cold it got when it came in
<personname> and <personname> kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse again
<personname> elbowed past <personname> to block <personname>s way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously
tm ine said <personname> jumping up
so we have finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies
let the feast begin the golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink
they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him
ignore him said <personname> who was right behind <personname>
he was not so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train
they are horrible things those dementors
but look said <personname> laughing see this morning
he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight
at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs
the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves
and around easter one of our number will leave us forever
<personname> trembled
i shall move among you helping and instructing
oh and dear she caught <personname> by the arm as he made to stand up after you have broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones
when <personname> and <personname> had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly
the falcon  my dear you have a deadly enemy
i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice
<personname> chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment
then you should know <personname> that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school
grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards there you are then said <personname> in a superior tone
that is it make sure you can see now firs thing you will want ter do is open yer books  how
really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off shut up <personname> said <personname> quietly
gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood
the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath
easy now <personname> said <personname> quietly
buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit <personname> had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four ill assorted feet hit the ground
it happened in a flash of steely talons <personname> let out a high-pitched scream and next moment <personname> was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at <personname> who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes
they should fire him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears
i am going to see if he is okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase
if we hurried we could go down and see him
tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of <personname> s beetle-black eyes
he grabbed both <personname> and <personname> and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug
i am not worth that 7 the boggart in the wardrobe <personname> did not reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions
he looked as though he was on the verge of tears
by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gone
thinking of trying to catch <personname> single-handed <personname>
<personname> let out a low sneering laugh
but if it was me i would want revenge
what are you talking about
everyone gather round said <personname> his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to <personname>s toad
it is only defense against the dark arts this afternoon
<personname> glared at <personname> it was bad enough that he bullied <personname> in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers
it is a shape-shifter she said
you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter
what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing
did not catch that <personname> sorry said professor <personname> cheerfully
<personname> backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly
you and <personname> answered my questions correctly at the start of the class <personname> <personname> said lightly
<personname> however was not feeling cheerful
but no one else seemed to have noticed anything
his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first
parvati patil and <personname> had taken to haunting professor trelawneys tower room at lunchtimes and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others did not
said <personname> after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms slimy throats
and we have got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match
oy <personname> roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously
<personname> hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox
parvati glared at her
it was full of chattering first and second years and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off
nothing said <personname> truthfully
well get back to your common room where you belong snapped <personname> and he stood glaring until <personname> had passed out of sight
where are <personname> and <personname>
<personname> said looking around for his kettle
something of <personname>s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because <personname> said anything worrying you <personname>
no <personname> lied
he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him
yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on <personname>s desk
why did not you let me fight it
he said again
well said <personname> frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of <personname>
clearly i was wrong said <personname> still frowning at <personname>
but i did not think it a good idea for <personname> to materialize in the staffroom
<personname> looked curiously at the goblet
pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering
i will see you at the feast later
the empty goblet was still smoking
said <personname> curiously
they heard <personname> say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor <personname>
and the fat lady sir
and <personname> has done the dungeons nothing there either
the owlery
asked <personname>
he was now being closely watched
why
think it will damage their chances
they have got a new captain and seeker <personname>  angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled
but <personname> did not move
he said
as i was saying before <personname> interrupted professor <personname> has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far  please sir we have done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said <personname> quickly and we are just about to start  be quiet said <personname> coldly
i would not have given it three
why is he got it in for <personname>
why could not <personname> have hidden in <personname>s office eh
in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale
go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot
at long last <personname> thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone
stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan
the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field
if the crowd was cheering they could not hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder
madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off
<personname> rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind
he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain
he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game
she was going to be murdered
all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten
<personname> made a small squeaky noise
but if they beat ravenclaw  no way ravenclaw is too good
did someone get my nimbus
<personname> spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon <personname> finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at <personname> which hit him in the face and caused <personname> to take fifty points from gryffindor
no said <personname>
i do not think any of us have seen professor <personname> that angry
he got away
mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukes resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again <personname> borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes
explain george
he probably suspected what it was though or he would not have confiscated it
you are winding me up said <personname> looking at the ragged old bit of parchment
astounded <personname> bent over it
see you in honeydukes said george winking
they left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of way
panting <personname> sped up his face hot his feet very cold
honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at <personname>
<personname> deserves a break
professors <personname> and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by <personname> who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak <personname> minister of magic
never saw one without the other did you
<personname> trusted <personname> beyond all his other friends
he advised them to go into hiding
as long as the secret-keeper refused to speak <personname> could search the village where <personname> and <personname> were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window so <personname> was the <personname>s secret-keeper
he did said <personname> heavily
i didn know he would bin <personname> an <personname>s secret-keeper
then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he did not manage to disappear did he
the ministry of magic caught up with him next day alas if only we had said <personname> bitterly
said madam rosmerta
well there you have it rosmerta said <personname> thickly
the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappeared
all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard
if he had not known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was <personname> in this old photograph
was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him
he could see <personname> laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes
<personname> could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep
<personname> looked at them
again <personname> did not answer
he is not out is he
from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moans
he bellowed and he flung himself onto <personname>s neck
<personname> what is it
<personname>s sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward <personname> who picked it up and read aloud dear mr <personname> further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor <personname> that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident
buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor
will not make no difference sobbed <personname>
said <personname>
er how are the flobberworms
oh no said <personname> his lip twitching
his eyes filled with tears
long as they have got a couple of hundred humans stuck there with  them so they can leech all the happiness out of  them they don give a damn who is guilty an who is not
he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again
he could feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it
what is the matter with you
cannot you shut that thing up
all that could be heard now were <personname>s stifled moans of pain and rage
christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning
but surely you already knew that sibyll
said <personname> scrambling to his feet
it will need to be checked for jinxes said professor <personname>
of course i am no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down  strip it down
i shall keep you informed
i have got to what if the dementors turn up at our match against ravenclaw
i cannot afford to fall off again
if we lose this game we have lost the quidditch cup all right then   said <personname>
okay said <personname>
now please stop badgering me
what is that
<personname> half wished that he had not asked what was under a dementors hood the answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor <personname> halfway up the stairs
<personname> asked her
why do not you just drop a couple of subjects
scabbers look scabbers <personname> was leaning away from <personname> looking utterly bewildered
he is gone and you know what was on the floor
i really hoped she would not be fit she is had some problems with injuries
put it here <personname> he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward
<personname>s pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away
you know what we have got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms
she was shorter than <personname> by about a head and <personname> could not help noticing nervous as he was that she was extremely pretty
ten galleons to me must find penelope excuse me  good for you <personname> roared <personname>
i did not feel a thing that would be because they er were not dementors said professor <personname>
the common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party
there was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks
throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of <personname> <personname> was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes
but then there was this draft  i woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down
oh said <personname> looking slightly put out
averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight <personname> saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of <personname>s wardrobe door
said <personname>
because her cat acted like all cats do <personname> continued doggedly
but she is still sticking up for it it is a maniac and she will not hear a word against it ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said <personname> wisely
<personname> started and looked around at <personname> who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her
a tiny dot was moving in his direction
i suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong
where are you
<personname> sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling green sludge
floating in midair
but famous <personname> is a law unto himself
<personname> had no proof yet
my dad did not strut said <personname> before he could stop himself
your father did not set much store by rules either <personname> went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice
his head was so swollen  shut up <personname> was suddenly on his feet
then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father had not got cold feet at the last moment
<personname>s uneven yellowish teeth were bared
<personname> had picked up the map
you do not think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers
do not expect me to cover up for you again <personname>
as <personname> passed the one-eyed witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he did not dare go and get it
<personname>s right it was stupid we should not have done it  he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and <personname> was walking toward them
one look at her face convinced <personname> that she had heard what had happened
said <personname>
cmon <personname> muttered and in a moment all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons
<personname> why did not you come to charms
i just made a mistake that is all i would better go and see professor flitwick and say sorry
<personname> snorted
we shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes <personname> began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise so as to clear the inner eye and the superconscious
i do not need help <personname> whispered
i am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of divination requires
there was a moments silence
then fine said <personname> suddenly getting up and cramming unfogging the future back into her bag
<personname> set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye
<personname> climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle but they were not there
mount your brooms said madam hooch
moments later <personname> pelted a bludger at warrington knocking the quaffle out of his hands alicia seized it and put it through the slytherin goal seventy-ten
you  <personname> was angry enough to hit <personname> but could not reach <personname> was panting with the effort of holding onto the firebolt but his eyes were sparkling maliciously
alicia took gryffindors penalty but she was so angry she missed by several feet
like a bullet he shot toward the slytherins
the tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers
<personname> started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table looking for the book
after about a minute inside it she burst out again screaming
he started at the sight of <personname>
the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly
as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask
take your time now  then tell me what you see within it
professor trelawneys head fell forward onto her chest
<personname> sank his head into his hands thinking
<personname> i do not know what is gotten into you lately said <personname> astounded
wrote me this mornin
every inch of him was trembling
scabbers it is me you idiot it is <personname> <personname> hissed
they heard a door open behind them and mens voices
stay still ouch he bit me <personname> be quiet <personname> whispered urgently
what is the matter with him
no go away crookshanks go away but the cat was getting nearer scabbers no too late the rat had slipped between <personname>s clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away
something was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow an enormous pale-eyed jet-black dog
<personname> was on his feet
the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer
both raised their wands to see what lay beyond
her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows
<personname> s grip on <personname>s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers
everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs
only one door was open
on a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks purring loudly at the sight of them
<personname> it is a trap  what  he is the dog  he is an animagus
the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull
it was <personname>
what is the matter gone soft in azkaban
they did not need telling twice
a livid bruise was rising around <personname>s left eye and his nose was bleeding
you never heard her did you
now was the moment to do it
unless <personname>s eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond <personname> something none of the rest could see  unless he was the one  unless you switched  without telling me
<personname> felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
you wrote
he had started to pace up and down looking at them
twenty minutes later you left <personname> and set off back toward the castle
no <personname> said <personname>
what is my rat got to do with anything
what dyou mean of course he is a rat  no he is not said <personname> quietly
<personname>s dead said <personname>
said <personname> astounded
finally in our fifth year they managed it
because i was too cowardly
he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am
and so i convinced myself that <personname> was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from <personname> that being an animagus had nothing to do with it  so in a way <personname>s been right about me all along
what is <personname> got to do with it
he is teaching here as well
it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred
for once in your life hold your tongue
<personname> avoided <personname>s eyes
he reached out a bony hand and stroked crookshanks s fluffy head
this cat crookshanks did you call him
he was a very short man hardly taller than <personname> and <personname>
my friends  my old friends  <personname>s wand arm rose but <personname> seized him around the wrist gave him a warning look then turned again to <personname> his voice light and casual
you have not been hiding from me for twelve years said <personname>
you have been hiding from <personname>s old supporters
i heard things in azkaban <personname>
he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at <personname>
innocent but scared squealed <personname>
but you <personname> i will never understand why i did not see you were the spy from the start
why else did you find a wizard family to take you in
it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors could not destroy it
i swam as a dog back to the mainland
i would have died before i betrayed them
forgive me <personname> said <personname>
how dare you face him
he sat there twitching with terror staring up at them
said <personname> with a terribly fury in his face
no <personname> yelled
you cannot
this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too without turning a hair
you are the only person who has the right to decide <personname> said <personname>
he said
as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward away from <personname> and <personname>
another bang crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap
ivooo he moaned
noooo  please
i am leaving the <personname>s
by the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor halt very close to him
the dementor must have released him
consider minister against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection out-of-bounds at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too  well well  we shall see <personname> we shall see
as for you two  you will be staying here until i am satisfied you are <personname> what do you think you are doing
it was <personname>
professor <personname> <personname>  for heavens sake said madam pomfrey hysterically
snarled <personname>
i wish to speak to <personname> and <personname> alone <personname> repeated
i am sure it is us
where did you get that hourglass thing
you shouldnve come <personname> whispered
there was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe
barely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and <personname> came charging out of them running toward the willow
why did not the dementors get <personname>
if the patronus was shining so brightly did not it light him up
any moment now that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon
there is nothing we can do
the dementors will be coming any moment back to <personname>s <personname> said
he could hear yelping in the distance
<personname> began to run
get behind here behind this bush i will explain
you have got to get out of here the dementors are coming macnairs gone to get them
i do not want to think about it <personname> moaned checking her watch again
it is five minutes to midnight
<personname> looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache
think about what you are saying
oh he is not unbalanced said <personname> quietly
why
said <personname>
i am no longer your teacher so i do not feel guilty about giving you back this as well
headmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manage
was it was she making a real prediction
it took a moment for <personname> to realize what <personname> had said
and then i remembered the most unusual form your patronus took when it charged mr <personname> down at your quidditch match against ravenclaw
two whole months before he would see it again
yeah i have been thinking about them too said <personname>
hang on there is a p
what is that
it stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face
unfriendly like
i always thought he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the bar
the wealthy man who owned the <personname> house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be
boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the <personname> house
plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and <personname> could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals
i can always tell wormtail you are regretting that you ever returned to me
without it i could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail
said <personname> defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the war
i do not know what you mean by wizard said <personname> his voice growing steadier
asleep was the way <personname> liked the <personname>s best it was not as though they were ever any help to him awake
<personname> had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went
yours sincerely <personname>
in any case <personname> did not like the idea of the whole <personname> family knowing that he <personname> was getting jumpy about a few moments pain
<personname>s diet is not going too well
he noticed that it was a lot smaller than <personname>s
is this it
aunt <personname> gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at <personname> who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing <personname>s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes
we would of course be glad to have <personname> stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school
seemed to think it was funny
<personname> decided to break the silence
uncle <personname> looked as outraged as if <personname> had just uttered a disgusting swear word
it is been a while since he heard from me and you know if he does not he might start thinking something is wrong
<personname> seized his eagle-feather quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wrote <personname> it is all okay the muggles say i can come
aunt <personname> was not eating anything at all
<personname> could not take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves
said <personname>
boys boys  said mr <personname> vaguely
they knew where <personname>s bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night
he said kindly
coming said <personname>
<personname> helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better
one bewildered second later <personname> realized that the foot-long thing was <personname>s tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him
ton-tongue toffee said <personname> brightly
how are you doing <personname>
she is furious at them anyway
i have got to keep him up here because he annoys errol and hermes
could you take the plates outside girls
a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred
you know the one i am talking about father
mum no one at the bank gives a damn how i dress as long as i bring home plenty of treasure said <personname> patiently
went down to transylvania three hundred and ninety to ten said <personname> gloomily
the portkey <personname> felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in <personname>s room when he was being shaken awake by mrs <personname>
he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt
said <personname> grumpily pulling his bowl of porridge toward him
he works for the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures
you beat <personname>l <personname> could not think of any reply to this so he remained silent
his feet left the ground he could feel <personname> and <personname> on either side of him their shoulders banging into his they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then his feet slammed into the ground <personname> staggered into him and he fell over the portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud
er is it my eyes or has everything gone green
let us go and have a look said <personname> pointing to a large patch of tents upheld where the bulgarian flag white green and red was fluttering in the breeze
<personname> said <personname> quietly
<personname> raised his eyes to the heavens
walking more slowly now because of the weight of the water they made their way back through the campsite
come here mr <personname> said <personname> kindly taking the box from him and showing him how to do it properly
<personname> hurried forward with his hand outstretched
the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule
see you all later he said
prime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets
ideas above his station sir
i is not liking heights at all <personname> she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sir
and let us see who else you know <personname> i daresay
i wonder what they have brought said mr <personname> leaning forward in his seat
all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happen
he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box
the crowd did not want the veela to go
presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynch
but levskis got the quaffle <personname> if you are not going to watch at normal speed you are going to miss things shouted <personname> who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field
<personname> focusing still more closely upon <personname>s face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below
he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference
and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those brooms  yes  there they go  and troy takes the quaffle  play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen
he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic
the crowd below was applauding appreciatively <personname> could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction
and then came the irish team
ah yes
by the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire
it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air
they all looked back as they reached the trees
said <personname> anxiously stopping so abruptly that <personname> walked into her
dyou want to be showing off your knickers in midair
beauxbatons muttered <personname>
said <personname>
i am a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures
well there is a sort of riot going on said <personname>
those poor muggles though said <personname> nervously
morsmordrel  and something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness <personname>s eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky
gasped <personname> as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appeared
he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them
there was someone behind the trees  they shouted words an incantation  oh stood over there did they
they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searching
her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way
amos think who you are talking to said mr <personname> very angrily
sorry  carried away  i did not drop it there anyway said <personname> jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull
of course everyone knows  muttered mr <personname> looking highly discomforted
mr <personname> i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos <personname> muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard
whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after they would done it leaving <personname>s wand behind
i do not get it said <personname> frowning
you are all right mrs <personname> muttered distractedly releasing mr <personname> and staring around at them all with red eyes you are alive
<personname> you are supposed to be on holiday this has not got anything to do with your office surely they can handle this without you
it was only a dream said <personname> bracingly
it is weird is not it
there was a silence in which <personname> fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his chudley cannons bedspread
<personname> said <personname> in an i-do not-think-you are being very sensitive sort of voice <personname> does not want to play quidditch right now
people keep sending howlers and of course if you do not open a howler straight away it explodes
i think you would all better go upstairs and check that you have packed properly said mrs <personname> breaking up the argument
the sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement
that is for you
<personname> looked away
<personname> she called up the staircase
a bit of what
the pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move
but my own mother will not say
durmstrang students actually learn them not just the defense rubbish we do
said <personname>
maybe said <personname> shrugging or it might have muggle-repelling charms on it like the world cup stadium
the lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor and <personname> bought a large stack of cauldron cakes for them to share
we saw him right up close as well said <personname>
i suppose you will <personname>
as if said <personname> picking up one of the remaining cauldron cakes and squashing it into a pulp
the four long house tables were packed with chattering students at the top of the hall the staff sat along one side of a fifth table facing their pupils
good evening he said beaming at them
the sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year but by an unlucky combination of circumstances <personname> had not been present at one since his own
he turned back to <personname> <personname> and nearly headless nick
he was judging by the <personname>s all seven of whom had been put into gryffindor
baddock malcolm slytherin the table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers <personname> could see <personname> clapping as baddock joined the slytherins
there was trouble in the kitchens earlier
there are house-elves here
she said
they get holidays do not they
oops sorry arry  he swallowed
you will not get them sick leave by starving yourself slave labor said <personname> breathing hard through her nose
it is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house quidditch cup will not take place this year
what
<personname> gasped
said <personname> brightly into the silence
it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this year
you are joking said <personname> loudly
i know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give your whole-hearted support to the hogwarts champion when he or she is selected
i will just have to oops
<personname>s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase
every now and then sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt and with a small phut it would be propelled forward several inches
it got me <personname> hurried over to him looking anxious
who would not want pets that can burn sting and bite all at once
<personname> would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon as <personname> <personname> and <personname> knew only too well he had owned one for a brief period during their first year a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert
what
he had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner
what
it was dull work requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles
mr <personname> appears to have rushed to the aid of mad eye <personname> the aged ex-auror who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder
has she always looked like that or was it just because you were with her
what what are you doing
yep said <personname>
surely professor <personname> told you that
they returned the books to their bags <personname> looking excited
your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago
curses
<personname> reached into the jar caught one of the spiders and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it
anyone else know one
<personname> nodded nervously but <personname> made no further inquiries
<personname>s hand shook slightly as for the third time she raised it into the air
you do not want to find yourself in a situation where you are facing it
why do not you come up to my office
yes said <personname> almost defiantly
<personname> did not join in with <personname> and <personname>s conversation during dinner but ate furiously fast and then left for the library again
the fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole and they climbed into the gryffindor common room which was crowded and noisy
he looked a good deal calmer than at the end of <personname>s lesson though still not entirely normal
yeah said <personname> sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table dipping his pen into some ink and starting to write
staring around the room trying to think of a kind of misfortune he had not yet used <personname> saw <personname> and george sitting together against the opposite wall heads together quills out poring over a single piece of parchment
<personname> and george had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and <personname> climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other
never heard of it said <personname>
well of course you have not said <personname> briskly i have only just started it
<personname> asked breathlessly
here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter dear <personname> i reckon i just imagined my scar hurting i was half asleep when i wrote to you last time
he spotted <personname> nestled between a barn owl and a tawny and hurried over to her sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor
she was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night
then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise
he had been so sure that <personname>s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them
but but you said it is illegal professor said <personname> uncertainly as <personname> cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room
<personname> watched as one by one his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence
not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse and each of them recovered only when <personname> had removed it
jump onto the desk
look at that you lot  <personname> fought he fought it and he damn near beat it we will try that again <personname> and the rest of you pay attention watch his eyes that is where you see it very good <personname> very good indeed they will have trouble controlling you the way he talks <personname> muttered as he hobbled out of the defense against the dark arts class an hour later <personname> had insisted on putting <personname> through his paces four times in a row until <personname> could throw off the curse entirely you would think we were all going to be attacked any second
talk about paranoid  <personname> glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that <personname> was definitely out of earshot and went on
professor <personname> was forcing them to research antidotes
<personname> noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning
what is a bummer
his and <personname>s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb <personname> s determination to pursue justice for house-elves
some people like <personname> had paid up just to stop <personname> from glowering at them
thanks <personname> he said stroking her
madame <personname> asked
look at the lake from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all
some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface waves were now washing over the muddy banks and then out in the very middle of the lake a whirlpool appeared as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lakes floor
a few moments later they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank
<personname> he called heartily as he walked up the slope

dyou think he would sign my hat in lipstick
over here come and sit over here <personname> hissed
last in line were professor <personname> professor <personname> and madame <personname>
good evening ladies and gentlemen ghosts and most particularly guests said <personname> beaming around at the foreign students
looks like they have finally found a food they like does not it
they organized the triwizard tournament did not they
when the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too
the girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough however and did not come over to get it
the lid creaked slowly open
to ensure that no underage student yields to temptation said <personname> i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall
now i think it is time for bed
<personname> thought briefly of <personname> s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind again
<personname> did not say where the durmstrang people are sleeping did he
but this query was answered almost instantly they were level with the slytherin table now and <personname> had just bustled up to his students
and unless you have got anything to say to <personname> <personname> you might want to move
as the next day was saturday most students would normally have breakfasted late
said <personname> shooting a repressive look at <personname> who staring at <personname>s odd hairstyle had just opened his mouth to say something about it
s okay though i have got  them in separate boxes now
they sat down at the table while <personname> started to make tea and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the triwizard tournament
go on <personname> <personname> <personname> and <personname> urged him but he just shook his head grinning
i will come with you said <personname> putting away his darning
no surprises there yelled <personname> as a storm of applause and cheering swept the hall
when <personname> too had vanished into the side chamber silence fell again but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it
i am sure i can count upon all of you including the remaining students from beauxbatons and durmstrang to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster
the fire in the goblet had just turned red again
automatically it seemed <personname> reached out a long hand and seized the parchment
i did not put my name in <personname> said blankly
the wizened witch started whispering in his ear
they looked strangely impressive silhouetted against the flames
may i introduce incredible though it may seem the fourth triwizard champion
otherwise we would of course have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools
do not you
yes he said instructions
mr <personname> turned to look at <personname>
ah  okay said <personname>
yet how could anyone think that when he was facing competitors who would had three years more magical education than he had when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people
<personname> was supposed to be far away in some distant country in hiding alone  feeble and powerless
it most certainly is not said the pale witch indignantly
you should have told us you would entered bellowed <personname> he looked half annoyed half deeply impressed
i did not he said over and over again i do not know how it happened
he looked up when <personname> slammed the door behind him
<personname> said
he walked resolutely over to the portrait hole pushed it open climbed out of it and found himself face-to-face with <personname>
they went downstairs crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the great hall and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake where the durmstrang ship was moored reflected blackly in the water
the look on your face when <personname> read out your name but the question is who did put it in
well borrow one of the school owls then anyone can use them said <personname>
the hufflepuffs who were usually on excellent terms with the gryffindors had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them
<personname> and <personname> guffawed sycophantically but <personname> had to stop there because <personname> emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates each containing a very large blast-ended skrewt
you say it wasn you an i believe you an <personname> believes yer an all
most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name
for one wild moment <personname> thought they were spew badges then he saw that they all bore the same message in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage support <personname> the real hogwarts champion like them <personname>
he felt the heat rise in his face and neck
<personname> attacked me sir  we attacked each other at the same time <personname> shouted
<personname> got <personname> <personname> said
he will come upstairs when this class is finished
now she leaned toward <personname> and said so <personname>  what made you decide to enter the triwizard tournament
said <personname> briskly
<personname>l cried <personname> with every appearance of delight but <personname> noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of magical mess remover and <personname>s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag
i particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat
<personname> did not look remotely abashed
said <personname> taking his place at the judges table and talking to the champions
very well very well it is in fine working order said mr ollivander scooping up the flowers and handing them to <personname> with her wand
he handed over his wand
he could remember it as though it had happened yesterday four summers ago on his eleventh birthday he had entered mr ollivanders shop with <personname> to buy a wand
he was very fond of his wand and as far as he was concerned its relation to <personname>s wand was something it could not help rather as he could not help being related to aunt <personname>
can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in gryffindor tower at one of the clock in the morning on the 22nd of november
or is this a school you and <personname> have set up together
he is not even good-looking she muttered angrily glaring at <personname>s sharp profile
they only like him because he is famous they would not look twice at him if he could not do that wonky faint thing  wronski feint said <personname> through gritted teeth
why do not we go and have a butterbeer in the three broomsticks it is a bit cold is not it
at half past eleven that evening <personname> who had pretended to go up to bed early pulled the invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room
<personname> crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so keeping an eye on his watch
he slipped past her with a whispered thanks and set off through the castle
you there <personname>
come with me keep quiet an keep yerself covered with that cloak said <personname>
there is a common welsh green over there the smaller one a swedish short-snout that blue-gray and a chinese fireball that is the red
<personname> reached the castle slipped in through the front doors and began to climb the marble stairs he was very out of breath but he did not dare slow down
we know he is a good actor said <personname> because he convinced the ministry of magic to set him free did not he
what is that got to do with you
i just wondered where you  <personname> broke off shrugging
when he would finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body he hurried off to find <personname> locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall where she was eating breakfast with <personname>
feeling too queasy to eat <personname> waited until <personname> had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge then dragged her out onto the grounds
<personname> <personname> said through gritted teeth will you shut up for a bit please
but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time and thought about what leaving the castle would mean he knew he could not do it
it was the only place he had ever been happy  well he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too but he could not remember that
dragons said <personname> speaking quickly in case professor flitwick came out to see where <personname> had got to
never mind said <personname> quickly he knew <personname> would be in trouble if he told the truth
<personname> and <personname> will know by now <personname> and <personname> both saw the dragons too
why are you telling me
he was sure <personname> would not have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself
er professor i am supposed to be in herbology  never mind that <personname>
shadowy figures were moving around inside it none of them clearly in focus
well that was easy really quidditch he said dully and a fat lot of help  that is right said <personname> staring at him very hard his magical eye barely moving at all
okay try again
now do not panic she said just keep a cool head
we have got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand
good luck
<personname> felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species
it stretched its wings as he looked down at it and bared its minuscule fangs
he walked out through the entrance of the tent the panic rising into a crescendo inside him
and there was the horntail at the other end of the enclosure crouched low over her clutch of eggs her wings half-furled her evil yellow eyes upon him a monstrous scaly black lizard thrashing her spiked tail leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground
will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg well this is going to shorten the odds on mr <personname> <personname> saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the horntail and over at the entrance to the enclosure professor <personname> professor <personname> and <personname> hurrying to meet him all of them waving him toward them their smiles evident even from this distance
<personname> he said very seriously whoever put your name in that goblet i i reckon they are trying to do you in it was as though the last few weeks had never happened as though <personname> were meeting <personname> for the first time right after he would been made champion
barking mad said <personname> shaking his head
only thing is it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs they took marks off for that he was not supposed to do any damage to them
<personname> <personname> and <personname> all came in together
fits does not it
shut it <personname> bellowed his hands over his ears
i have not done anything to them
most of the class <personname> <personname> and <personname> in the lead had fled into <personname> s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in <personname> <personname> and <personname> however were among those who remained outside trying to help <personname>
said <personname> apparently full of lively interest
the prophet does a zoological column every wednesday as i am sure you know
until friday night then <personname> she will twist everything he says <personname> said under his breath
what is the matter
wait a minute <personname>
said <personname> frowning at her
i came down here just now to talk to them all and i found oh come on <personname> i want to show you she seized his arm again pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl stretched out her forefinger and tickled the huge green pear
there were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt
would <personname> like a cup of tea
he squeaked loudly over winkys sobs
she dissolved yet again in tears they could hear her sobbing into her skirt poor master poor master no winky to help him no more they could not get another sensible word out of winky
see you <personname> <personname>  can <personname> come and see you sometimes sir
does not think much of bagman though does she
the unexpected task <personname> <personname> will you pay attention
professor <personname>s irritated voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday and <personname> and <personname> both jumped and looked up
but i do not  you heard me <personname> said professor <personname> in a very final sort of way
<personname> asked <personname> as a dozen or so girls walked past them sniggering and staring at <personname>
got any idea who you are going to try
she was quite good-looking said <personname> fairly after he would stopped laughing
springing a test on us on the last day
it was <personname> and george
i suppose there is always <personname> he said gloomily referring to the ghost who haunted the girls toilets on the second floor
but every time he glimpsed <personname> that day during break and then lunchtime and once on the way to history of magic she was surrounded by friends
yes indeed dear she trilled straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him
we are the only ones left who have not got anyone well except <personname>
oh well spotted she said acidly
said <personname> and her eyes flashed dangerously
<personname> made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from <personname> and george in future
i will not fit into my dress robes oooh there is a tragedy <personname> snapped as <personname> went out into the entrance hall
twitchy little ferret are not you <personname>
but he is right <personname> said <personname> you have still got two tasks to do
<personname> awoke very suddenly on christmas day
<personname> is only wanting to wish <personname> merry christmas and bring him a present sir <personname> did say <personname> could come and see him sometimes sir it is okay said <personname> still breathing rather faster than usual while his heart rate returned to normal
you er look nice he said awkwardly
parvati shrugged
where is <personname>
he said again
pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with <personname> and even he did not seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her
i have been promoted <personname> said before <personname> could even ask and from his tone he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe
<personname> wanted very much to ask whether mr <personname> had stopped calling <personname> weatherby yet but resisted the temptation
it now occurred to <personname> that he had never actually heard <personname> speak before but he was certainly talking now and very enthusiastically at that
meanwhile <personname> was criticizing the hogwarts decorations to roger davies
<personname> <personname> was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with professor sinistra who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg
oh but this is a really good one parvati said as the weird sisters struck up a new song which was much faster
she said
do not be so stupid she said after a moment
<personname> watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face
vare is herm-own-ninny
how do you feel the tournaments going mr bagman
and then we have been trying to persuade the transylvanians to sign the international ban on dueling
which side you got it on
said <personname>
passwords pine fresh
that had been extremely strange advice
oh it is so beautiful whispered <personname>
girls to the front and approach with care come on easy does it
half giant  and there was me thinking he would just swallowed a bottle of skele-gro when he was young
she was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from beauxbatons in hogsmeade on the next weekend trip
that was a really good lesson said <personname> as they entered the great hall
her reaction was exactly the same as <personname>s
like you and <personname> did you mean said <personname>
they could hear fang scratching at the door whining but it did not open
he is not at all like you would think coming from durmstrang
<personname> said nothing
heart sinking he went up to the bar with <personname> and <personname> ordered three butter-beers from madam rosmerta and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all
thanks said <personname> but he knew this could not be all that bagman wanted to say because he could have congratulated <personname> in front of <personname> and <personname>
<personname> said noticing how the goblins were still watching bagman very closely
because <personname>s still poking around everywhere she can and i am willing to bet she would work up <personname>s illness into something sinister
he is still ill
she was wearing banana-yellow robes today her long nails were painted shocking pink and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer
<personname> she said beaming
<personname> raised her heavily penciled eyebrows
your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it
even ludo bagman  sit down you silly little girl and do not talk about things you do not understand said <personname> coldly her eyes hardening as they fell on <personname>
oh i will get her back for this
<personname> went slightly pink but <personname> smiled at her and continued <personname> <personname> and <personname> still seem to want to know you judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door
look at the <personname>s an excellent point said professor <personname>
it was all over the papers but did aberforth hide
no he did not he held his head high and went about his business as usual of course i am not entirely sure he can read so that may not have been bravery
<personname> gulped
<personname> stood up
here  <personname> got up went over to his dresser opened a drawer and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with <personname>s crinkled black eyes beaming as he sat on top of <personname>s shoulder
<personname> <personname> said in outrage i am i am not wearing anything the foam was so dense that this hardly mattered but he had a nasty feeling that <personname> had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived
i am honored said <personname> darkly
he had never seen <personname> so cheerful apart from the day when a dose of polyjuice potion had given <personname> the hairy face and tail of a cat
good said <personname> vaguely
my sweet mrs norris was obviously with him this is a triwizard clue this belongs to a school champion <personname> felt sick his heart was hammering very fast peeves <personname> roared gleefully
he had had occasion before now to wonder whether the invisibility cloak worked on cats
why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam
not hiding anything else in your office are you
hand it over now
oh if there is one thing i hate he muttered more to himself than to <personname> and his magical eye was fixed on the left-hand corner of the map it is a death eater who walked free
could <personname> possibly mean what <personname> thought he meant
he was very fond of his map but on the other hand he was extremely relieved that <personname> was not asking where he would got it and there was no doubt that he owed <personname> a favor
right bed <personname> come on now
they climbed to the top of the stairs together <personname> still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before
what did he think <personname> was concealing in his office
<personname> whispered his eyes alight with interest as he banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand it soared into the air and knocked parvatis hat off
<personname> loved taking points from <personname> and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school
i spose i could always attack someone in front of <personname> he might do it for me
no i think your best chance is some sort of charm
familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb <personname> now and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again
i can feel it
i would not mind said <personname>s voice
said <personname> looking surprised
bring as many of these books as you can okay
he carried them over to a table then set to work searching them by the narrow beam of his wand occasionally checking his watch
the entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers all leaving the great hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task
<personname> was staring unblinkingly ahead of him trying to discern shapes through the gloom  and then without warning something grabbed hold of his ankle
he knew he must be even deeper in the lake now but nothing was moving but the rippling weed
their heads were lolling onto their shoulders and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths
come on <personname> said fiercely but only bubbles issued from his mouth and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman but the merman yanked it back still shaking his head and laughing
it was very slow work
cmon <personname> said shortly help me with her i do not think she can swim very well
gabrielle gabrielle is she alive
he would have told her about <personname> but he had just noticed <personname> watching him
you saved er she said breathlessly
i deserved zero said <personname> throatily shaking her magnificent head
all of them were looking at something <personname> could not see and sniggering heartily
deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents fourteen-year-old <personname> thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts muggle born <personname>
she repeated shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at <personname>
said <personname> who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk a good six inches from his bowl because he was looking at <personname>
now
in truth he had not stolen either of these things from <personname>
for one wild moment <personname> thought <personname> was about to pull out his wand and curse him then he saw that <personname> had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion
now the use of this potion is controlled by very strict ministry guidelines
said <personname> still making every effort not to move his lips
<personname> <personname> and <personname> climbed over the stile and followed
tethered at the end of it one end of his rope around a large rock was buckbeak the hippogriff
your last letter  well let us just say things are getting fishier
phrases jumped out at him has not been seen in public since november  house appears deserted  st
<personname> sacked his house-elf
<personname> shot back
how dyou know where he disapparated to
come off it said <personname> incredulously
oh never a <personname> supporter he said reading the look on <personname>s face
for a moment the deadened look in <personname>s eyes became more pronounced than ever as though shutters had closed behind them
<personname> says <personname> is obsessed with catching dark wizards <personname> told <personname>
and he sneaked up here to search <personname>s office said <personname> triumphantly looking at <personname>
why did not he just let him die
<personname> knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year and he was part of a gang of slytherins who nearly all turned out to be death eaters
<personname> held up his fingers and began ticking off names
yeah you should have seen <personname>s face when <personname> turned up in potions yesterday said <personname> quickly
well i have no idea what that is about  but if <personname>s genuinely worried and he is going to <personname> for answers  <personname> stared at the cave wall then made a grimace of frustration
there is still the fact that <personname> trusts <personname> and i know <personname> trusts where a lot of other people would not but i just cannot see him letting <personname> teach at hogwarts if he would ever worked for <personname>
he was tough but he never descended to the level of the death eaters
what was he doing at the world cup that was so important he did not turn up in the top box
yes he is quoted in the article in there said <personname> nodding at the paper
but you are not to go leaving hogwarts without permission it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you
wonder if <personname> knows all that stuff about <personname>
if he thought we were standing in the way of his career  <personname>s really ambitious you know
said <personname> who was looking around
well it is not strong that stuff <personname> said
the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen
thank you for the socks <personname> <personname> called miserably from the hearth where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was winky
as he watched madame <personname> emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to <personname>
i warned her not to annoy <personname> look at this one  he read out one of the letters <personname> had left behind  i read in witch weekly about how you are playing <personname> false and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as i can find a big enough envelope
<personname>s heart sank at the sight of the crates surely not another skrewt hatching
hang on said <personname> looking down into the crate there is a spare niffler here  who is missin
said <personname>
the gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup said <personname>
listen i had other stuff on my mind that night said <personname> impatiently
i hate that <personname> woman she burst out savagely
what is the point
what dyou reckon it is going to be
well what dyou think
bagman grinned at <personname> and <personname>
said <personname> as they passed <personname>s cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriage
will mr <personname>s eyes were bulging
<personname> said loudly
his eyes were rolling and bulging and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin
look said <personname> angrily <personname> is not right he is he is out of his mind he says he wants to warn the stone wall behind <personname> slid open
he was wearing his sleek silver furs and he looked pale and agitated
what is this
cmon <personname>
the less you lot ave ter do with these foreigners the happier you will be
i do not think so said <personname> shaking his head
<personname> attacked <personname> no wait for it and then stunned himself and mr <personname> evaporated did he
he mentioned his son
dyou reckon he could have beaten you and <personname> there
<personname> could hear two voices arguing coming closer and closer
well do not let us hold you up <personname> said making a mock bow and pointing at the door
who are you blackmailing
georges right you could end up in serious trouble for that
they would tell <personname>
let us give it till break
mind works the right way granger
he yawned widely so that his scars stretched and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth
should be right up your street this one said <personname> looking up at <personname> and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin
keep your head down and look after yourself
just like <personname> and <personname> so listen to them no ones tried to attack me all year said <personname>
well i think <personname>s got it now anyway said <personname> hastily
should slow down anything that is trying to attack you <personname>
see you at dinner said <personname> and she set off for arithmancy while <personname> and <personname> headed toward north tower and divination
my dears said professor trelawney sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes we have almost finished our work on planetary divination
you are in luck wormtail said a cold high-pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed
the pensieve the door of the office opened
come in then
he felt much calmer somehow now that he was in <personname>s office knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream
a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt which <personname> recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year
it looked like light made liquid or like wind made solid <personname> could not make up his mind
<personname> said a curt voice to <personname>s left
but for filth like this  <personname> said softly
we never knew the names of every one of our fellows he alone knew exactly who we all were  which was a wise move was not it as it prevented someone like you <personname> from turning all of them in muttered <personname>
no shouted <personname> straining at the chains that bound him to the chair
the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event
it was a different memory a different day  a different trial
the day ludo bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the ministry
he looked down upon the four in front of him and there was pure hatred in his face
mother stop him mother i did not do it it was not me i now ask the jury shouted mr <personname> to raise their hands if they believe as i do that these crimes deserve a life sentence in azkaban in unison the witches and wizards along the right hand side of the dungeon raised their hands
i am your son he screamed up at <personname>
<personname> started
er said <personname> who could not truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort
one simply siphons the excess thoughts from ones mind pours them into the basin and examines them at ones leisure
curiosity is not a sin he said
then he did the cruciatus curse on wormtail and my scar hurt <personname> said
it is my belief that your scar hurts both when <personname> is near you and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred
said <personname> quietly
they are both in st
i believe <personname> visits them with his grandmother during the holidays
those attacks caused a wave of fury such as i have never known
unfortunately the <personname>s evidence was given their condition none too reliable
the third task <personname> reckons <personname>s getting stronger again as well
<personname> thought he saw <personname> shiver slightly even though the evening was warm
said <personname> in utter disbelief
true to his word to <personname> he had not told <personname> and <personname> about <personname>s parents
<personname> was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it
breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task
he stared at the headline and said no way
slytherins up and down the table were sniggering twisting in their seats to see <personname>s reaction
are you all right
i have had an idea <personname> said gazing into space
<personname> i would better hurry i am going to be late for binns
then he saw mrs <personname> and <personname> standing in front of the fireplace beaming at him
he said you were incredible against the horntail
he said looking <personname> up and down
<personname> had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with <personname> and mrs <personname> showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship
not good said <personname>
it is all right he said helping himself to a cornish pasty while mrs <personname> looked stern they are all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it was not hard
<personname> kept glancing along the table at her
they walked onto the quidditch field which was now completely unrecognizable
he held out his wand ready to attack but its beam fell only upon <personname> who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side
<personname> wished it could have stayed he could have used some company  but he moved on quickly and quietly as possible listening hard his wand held high once more
did he dare move his foot
immediately the world righted itself
he took a deep steadying breath then got up again and hurried forward looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight
the spell hit the skrewts armor again and ricocheted off <personname> staggered back a few paces and fell over
it was not very effective but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which <personname> forced his leg kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it tearing his robes and looking to his right saw <personname> jerking and twitching on the ground <personname> standing over him
he would deserve it <personname> muttered but all the same he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air which hovered high above <personname> marking the spot where he lay
his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever but he could hardly believe what he would just seen <personname> do
she was not crouching as if to spring but pacing from side to side of the path blocking his progress
he asked tentatively
but <personname> did not move
that is twice you have saved my neck in here
that is you
i had help on the egg in the first place said <personname>
just take the cup no said <personname>
we will tie for it
for a moment <personname> looked as though he could not believe his ears then his face split in a grin
he raised his head
he got up pulled <personname> to his feet and they looked around
a swishing noise and a second voice which screeched the words to the night avada kedavrav a blast of green light blazed through <personname>s eyelids and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched and then it diminished terrified of what he was about to see he opened his stinging eyes
once sure that <personname> was bound so tightly to the headstone that he could not move an inch wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into <personname>s mouth then without a word he turned from <personname> and hurried away
wormtail was speaking
<personname> turned his scarlet eyes upon <personname> laughing a high cold mirthless laugh
<personname> examined it carefully ignoring wormtails uncontrollable weeping
listen to me reliving family history  he said quietly why i am growing quite sentimental
the death eaters behind him did the same each of them approaching <personname> on his knees and kissing his robes before backing away and standing up forming a silent circle which enclosed <personname>s grave <personname> <personname> and the sobbing and twitching heap that was wormtail
i smell guilt he said
i see you all whole and healthy with your powers intact such prompt appearances and i ask myself  why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master to whom they swore eternal loyalty
at the mention of <personname>s name the members of the circle stirred and some muttered and shook their heads
the tortured death eater lay flat upon the ground gasping
my <personname> i was constantly on the alert came <personname>s voice swiftly from beneath the hood
the <personname>s should stand here said <personname> quietly
you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body i tried to kill him
i could possess the bodies of others
then  four years ago  the means for my return seemed assured
i knew that to achieve this it is an old piece of dark magic the potion that revived me tonight i would need three powerful ingredients
<personname> invoked an ancient magic to ensure the boys protection as long as he is in his relations care
and then the boy would return to hogwarts where he is under the crooked nose of that muggle-loving fool from morning until night
but i want there to be no mistake in anybodys mind
there was a split second perhaps when <personname> might have considered running for it but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave as the death eaters closed ranks forming a tighter circle around him and <personname> so that the gaps where the missing death eaters should have stood were filled
and now we duel
i will not do it i will not say it
<personname> following the beam with his astonished gaze saw that <personname>s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating
<personname>  whispered the figure of <personname> take my body back will you
he was looking up at the starry sky and <personname> was crouched over him
clunk
blood said <personname> raising his arm
<personname>
it was i who did that
he said
you did not  it it cannot be you
but i also had to contend with your stupidity
feed you information from another innocent source
but i think in the excitement of tonight our fake <personname> might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done  on the hour  every hour
but bertha jorkins heard winky talking to me
my father arrived home
sobbed winky
i had loved quidditch
winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father
winky would appear to be alone
there were times when i was almost myself again
she had her face hidden
he dismissed winky
and i was released
we journeyed to his house
there was a commotion
i took his leg and his eye
but your father escaped said <personname>
i told him my father hated dark wizards
of course said professor <personname>
he had put a hand on <personname>s shoulder
he took a deep breath and began to tell them
what he needs now is sleep and peace and quiet
before he could finish the potion before he could say another word his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep
he could see the fuzzy outlines of mrs <personname> and <personname> close by
<personname> i am surprised at you i asked you to stand guard over <personname> <personname>  there is no need to stand guard over him anymore <personname> she shrieked
he insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle
blustered <personname>
<personname> still had that strange smile on his face
you are prepared to believe that <personname> has returned on the word of a lunatic murderer and a boy who  well  <personname> shot <personname> another look and <personname> suddenly understood
he said looking at <personname>
<personname> had taken half a step back from <personname> but he looked no less stubborn
i will be in touch with you tomorrow <personname> to discuss the running of this school
he had almost reached the door when he paused
ill go now
also if she will consent to come madame <personname>
you will shake hands
<personname>s attitude though not unexpected changes everything
yeah  of course i do
<personname> take the rest of your potion
i should not have won it
i told him to take the cup with me said <personname>
mrs <personname> s grief seemed to be beyond tears
from what <personname> and <personname> told him <personname> had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast
bin having a cuppa with <personname> <personname> said
he said gruffly
but you will be
got a little job fer me over the summer said <personname>
his expression was difficult to read
the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off
he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork
<personname> had already started walking away when <personname> burst out can i have your autograph
bugging said <personname> happily
but you said they did not work  oh not electronic bugs said <personname>
into a beetle
there was a beetle on the statue the night we heard <personname> telling madame <personname> about his mum exactly said <personname>
who used the furnunculus curse
but <personname> <personname> and <personname> kept on asking and finally <personname> said all right all right if you really want to know  it was ludo bagman
ignored our letter
they say you drew with <personname> and bagman was betting you would win outright
what
he left the compartment before they could say another word stepping over <personname> <personname> and <personname> who were still lying on the floor covered in hex marks
<personname>s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby
i do not know said aunt <personname> unconcernedly
<personname> was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush mrs figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street
making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our  i did not make that noise said <personname> firmly
what are all those  she too lowered her voice so that <personname> had to lip-read the next word  owls doing if they are not bringing you news
he would not want to lose face in front of the gang but he would be terrified of provoking <personname> it would be really fun to watch <personname>s dilemma to taunt him watch him with him powerless to respond  and if any of the others tried hitting <personname> <personname> was ready he had his wand  let them try  he would love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell but they did not turn around they did not see him they were almost at the railings
there you go <personname> <personname> thought dully
bye dud see ya big d <personname> waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again
said <personname>
<personname> grinned again
you just wait till i tell dad you had that thing out  running to daddy now are you
that is what we call it when it goes all dark like this
<personname> gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice
w-where are you
what are you d-do
will you shut up
there was something in the alleyway apart from themselves something that was drawing long hoarse rattling breaths
he heard <personname> blundering away hitting the alley fence stumbling
<personname> made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight but do not put it away idiot boy she shrieked
hang on it was him
said <personname> staring at her
he said staring from mrs figg to <personname> and <personname>
dementors you useless skiving sneak thief dementors
it  it was a very good business opportunity see  mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food
in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed <personname> which suited him perfectly
shh he is trying to say something <personname> what is it diddy
the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hog warts school of witchcraft and wizardry
it was all over
he growled
<personname>s brain reeled
i heard that awful boy telling her about them years ago she said jerkily
what now
do your lot have the death penalty
he added as a hopeful afterthought
and they will sentence you there
<personname> and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said <personname> speaking fast fighting to control his temper
they did not take he is still got his  she seized <personname> by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him
if it was demenders who hurt <personname> how come you have been expelled
why else would they be down that alleyway
said <personname>
get going then said <personname>
otherwise the <personname>s kept well clear of his bedroom
he could not return to living full-time with the <personname>s not now that he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged was it possible that he might be able to move into <personname>s house as <personname> had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry himself
sorry
<personname> heard the key turn in the lock and uncle <personname>s footsteps walking heavily down the stairs
there was silence for a few seconds and then he heard voices
professor <personname>
he had very good reason to be suspicious
<personname> <personname> who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk missing from his nose was squinting suspiciously at <personname> through his mismatched eyes
i want three-hundred and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey
<personname> says you are a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice
anyway you would better go and get packed <personname> we want to be ready to go when the signal comes
oh this is better she added as they entered <personname>s bedroom and he turned on the light
i am a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions
well that is a bit better i have never quite got the hang of these sort of householdy spells
wow a firebolt
both buttocks still on
locomotor trunk
back in the kitchen <personname> had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made <personname> feel sick
clear night grunted <personname> his magical eye scanning the heavens
we do not break ranks for anything got me
the cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks and every thought of the ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head
he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead
but where is
he looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him <personname> and <personname> carrying his trunk and <personname>s cage
<personname> we wanted to tell you we really did  <personname> began
who is in it
he demanded looking from one to the other
er said <personname>
the door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared
though he knew perfectly well that <personname> was highly ambitious <personname>s impression was that <personname> had not made a great success of his first job at the ministry of magic
why not
<personname> let out a low whistle
i know you do not said <personname> quickly looking frightened
go and wash them before dinner please <personname> grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room leaving <personname> alone with <personname> and <personname> again
the old woman was drooling her eyes were rolling the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed and all along the hall behind them the other portraits awoke and began to yell too so that <personname> actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears
shut up you horrible old hag shut up he roared seizing the curtain mrs <personname> had abandoned
the old womans screeches died and an echoing silence fell
panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes <personname>s godfather <personname> turned to face him
somen say m name
owe you a pology grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud
opposite <personname> <personname> was entertaining <personname> and <personname> by transforming her nose between mouthfuls
they have suffered losses too
for some reason mrs <personname> threw a very nasty look at <personname> before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding
<personname> said very quietly
it pays to have someone like dung around he hears things we do not
she has not forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you
<personname> said mrs <personname> rounding on her husband
more than he thinks we do anyway said <personname>
how dyou know what his plans are
<personname>
but you are telling people are not you
i want you in bed now
mrs <personname> beckoned imperiously to her sons and <personname>
demort said <personname> firmly
we already knew nearly everything they told us from using the extendable ears
that is where he hid the sorcerers stone a weapons going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said <personname>
it was around these that mrs <personname> <personname> <personname> <personname> and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths
a loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by <personname> knocking over the umbrella stand
at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep
cannot hear properly  dyou reckon we can risk the extendable ears
george asked
master always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mothers heart  my mother did not have a heart kreacher <personname> snapped
now go away kreacher
<personname> and the others followed
i used to be there said <personname> pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn
was he killed by an auror
she was very red in the face and still looked angry
and <personname> remembered he had seen <personname> inside <personname>s pensieve the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to <personname> her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty
<personname> understood completely
toast
<personname> glanced at <personname> then said to <personname> what were you saying about scrimgeour
<personname> shrugged
good luck said <personname>
the grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chains rattling all the while while the same cool female voice <personname> had heard in the telephone box rang out again
when the doors opened two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards but several more memos zoomed in so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it
mr <personname> said <personname> as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming are not we underground
two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls on top of which were tottering piles of files
mr <personname> stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chest
<personname> was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to <personname>
all eyes were now on <personname>
you er got our er message that the time and er place of the hearing had been changed then
you are <personname> <personname> of number four privet drive little whinging surrey
yes said <personname> angrily but i only used it because we were  the witch with the monocle on <personname>s left cut across him in a booming voice
and who exactly are you
incidentally can squibs see dementors
said madam bones narrowing her eyes so that the monocles edges disappeared into her flesh
one of them had fallen
on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased away the second from his cousin
that was what happened mrs figg repeated
the odds on that must be very very long even bagman would not have bet  oh i do not think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said <personname> lightly
the witch sitting to the right of <personname> with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent
yes you have said <personname> forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge <personname>
she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle <personname> and a very wide slack mouth
said madam bones s booming voice
<personname> stood up
said <personname> sharply
well i would better get going there is a vomiting toilet in bethnal green waiting for me
do not you go feeling guilty said <personname> sternly after <personname> had confided some of his feelings to her and <personname> while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later
you belong at hogwarts and <personname> knows it
come off it said <personname> and <personname> together but <personname> merely shrugged
said <personname> heatedly
there is been a mistake said <personname> snatching the letter out of <personname>s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark
she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be
i will see you all later little <personname>nie a prefect and do not forget to pack your trunks a prefect  oh i am all of a dither she gave <personname> yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room
we could curtsy if you like said george
he straightened up and looked behind him
<personname> screwed up his face and buried it in his hands
you have your drink
i think <personname> might have hoped that i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said <personname>
we need them for the skiving snackboxes but they are a class c non-tradeable substance so we have been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them
said <personname>
<personname> took a swig from his hip flask his electric blue eye staring sideways at <personname>
that is <personname> and <personname>  <personname>s stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at <personname> he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son <personname>
i am just s-s-so worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again
do not worry about <personname> said <personname> abruptly
the door slammed behind them and mrs <personname>s screeches were cut off instantly
do not think we were followed seconds later mr <personname> emerged onto the platform with <personname> and <personname>
we will see you soon i expect
shall we go and find a compartment then
fine
the train rattled onward speeding them out into open country
liquid squirted from every boil on the plant thick stinking dark-green jets of it they hit the ceiling the windows and spattered <personname>s magazine
um  said <personname>
she closed the door again rather pink in the face and departed
i do not think i would have minded she added thoughtfully i do not like dancing very much
upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was but <personname> now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of <personname> <personname> only recognized him because of the lime-green bowler hat
i have written to the minister of magic and am expecting him to give stubby alias <personname> a full pardon any day now
not altogether reassured <personname> followed her
well we think he is a bit of a joke in ravenclaw said <personname> unfazed
who is that
they lit first upon professor <personname> sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long staff table wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat
said ravenclaw we will teach those whose intelligence is surest
said gryffindor we will teach all those with brave deeds to their name said hufflepuff 111 teach the lot and treat them just the same
and never since the founders four were whittled down to three have the houses been united as they once were meant to be
his mouth was so full <personname> thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all
we ghosts though we belong to separate houses maintain links of friendship
asked <personname>
when all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward again <personname> got to his feet once more
the quiet that always filled the hall when <personname> was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together whispering and giggling
meanwhile at the hufflepuff table ernie macmillan was one of the few still staring at professor <personname> but he was glassy-eyed and <personname> was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefects badge gleaming on his chest
said <personname> in surprise
i am actually going to be able to remember it for once  he waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train
you
dean who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper went oddly still and <personname> knew he was listening hard
if you have got a problem sharing a dormitory with me go and ask <personname> if you can be moved stop your mummy worrying  leave my mother out of this <personname> what is going on
<personname> and <personname> both gave <personname> it is-his-problem-not yours looks but <personname> was not much consoled
because we are prefects said <personname> as they climbed out through the portrait hole
what are you still getting that for
nothing about you or <personname> or anything
professor <personname> was now moving along the table handing out schedules
said <personname> suspiciously
but we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement
except  well  he looked slightly sheepish
yeah said <personname> trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying
his own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray steam <personname>s was spitting green sparks
cannot you give it a rest
turn please to the introduction and read what imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation
well good afternoon she said when finally the whole class had sat down
i should like you please to reply good afternoon professor <personname>
there was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class
when i ask you a question i should like you to reply yes professor <personname> or no professor <personname>
well i do not said <personname> bluntly
it is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you he actually performed them on you  well he turned out to be a maniac did not he
mind you we still learned loads your hand is not up mr thomasy trilled professor <personname>
everyone was staring at either <personname> or <personname>
professor <personname> stood up and leaned toward them her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk
i saw him i fought him detention mr <personname> said professor <personname> triumphantly
five of the clock
the ministry of magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any dark wizard
is it true that you shouted at professor <personname>
and sit down
thanks he said grudgingly
pur  lease  what i do not get said <personname> in a shaking voice laying down his knife and fork his hands were trembling too much to hold them steady is why they all believed the story two months ago when <personname> told them the thing is <personname> i am not sure they did said <personname> grimly
she slammed down her own knife and fork <personname> looked sadly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit
cannot we just  let us just do that homework get it out of the way they collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire
<personname> kept his face averted from the portrait hole but could still sense the stares he was attracting
yeah you are right said george nodding this dosage looks strong enough does not it
several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor or dangling off their chairs that <personname> was sure <personname> and george had not warned them what the sweets were going to do
onlookers all over the room were laughing
and in the meantime i am afraid we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice they then spent more than an hour reviewing summoning charms which according to professor flitwick were bound to come up in their owl and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of charms homework ever
<personname> made a sad little disbelieving noise
there is nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence
these are easier than conjuring spells which you would not usually attempt until newt level but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your owl she was quite right <personname> found the vanishing spells horribly difficult
everyone here
<personname> pulled out parchment and quill crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what <personname> had just said
it is just playing into <personname>s hands to look worried it tells him we do not know exactly what is going on
if he calls <personname> a moron one more time  snarled <personname>
er right said <personname> awkwardly
<personname> was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings a fact that parvati and <personname> seemed to have noticed as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes
<personname> gave her a withering look and flounced away radishes swinging madly
dyou mind not offending the only people who believe me
<personname>s told me all about her apparently she will only believe in things as long as there is no proof at all
said <personname> skeptically as they sat down at the gryffindor table
these were so foul that <personname> stared at them transfixed until professor <personname> spoke again
no you will come here at five of the clock tomorrow and the next day and on friday too and you will do your detentions as planned
<personname> raised the sharp black quill and then realized what was missing
well we will just have to try again tomorrow evening will not we
<personname>s third detention passed in the same way as the previous two except that after two hours the words i must not tell lies did not fade from the back of <personname>s hand but remained scratched there oozing droplets of blood
it is just a cut it is nothing it is  but <personname> had grabbed <personname>s forearm and pulled the back of <personname>s hand up level with his eyes
the parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back of his hand which was searing with pain
he could have her under the imperius curse i suppose <personname> watched <personname> george and lee jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment
do not say that it is not true i think i will write and tell <personname> about it see what he thinks  <personname> you cannot put something like that in a letter said <personname> looking alarmed
said <personname> his face contorting with rage
thanks <personname> said
and we have got tomorrow
we have got bludgers for that katies nose was bleeding
she was ignoring the slytherins who had now set up a chant of  gryffindor are losers gryffindor are losers but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless
at half-past eleven <personname> wandered over to them yawning
the farther down the parchment his eyes traveled the more pronounced became his scowl
he thrust the letter at <personname> and <personname> who leaned toward each other to read it together dear <personname> i have only just heard from no less a person than the minister of magic himself who has it from your new teacher professor <personname> that you have become a hogwarts prefect i was most pleasantly surprised when i heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations
<personname> had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug gazing into the flames
nevertheless he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time it had vanished so quickly <personname>s head
<personname> began but <personname> said quickly we will tell you afterward go on <personname>
she is not letting us use magic at all all we do is read the stupid textbook said <personname>
for a full account of madam marchbanks alleged links to subversive goblin groups turn to page 17
oh i cannot wait to see <personname> inspected said <personname> happily
the general standard of this homework was abysmal
<personname> made a noncommittal noise in his throat
something we can build on  they sat down together at the gryffindor table
what on earth does that stand for
still smiling professor <personname> grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind professor trelawneys seat
oh i do not know  said <personname> desperately who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days
let us say i dreamed i was  drowning <personname> in my cauldron
well if you could just predict something for me then
professor <personname>s eyebrows were still raised
<personname> and <personname> told <personname> who had been in arithmancy exactly what had happened in divination while they all took out their copies of defensive magical theory but before <personname> could ask any questions professor <personname> had called them all to order and silence fell
you disagree
are you telling me she said lowering her voice so that the group of curious ravenclaws behind them could not hear that after the warning i gave you last monday you lost your temper in professor <personname>s class again
now the vanishing spell  hem hem
i wonder said professor <personname> in cold fury turning on professor <personname> how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me
quite correct said professor grubbly-plank hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet
yes please do said professor <personname> scribbling upon her clipboard
most people were able to answer well and <personname>s spirits lifted somewhat at least the class was not letting <personname> down
a hippogriff
jolly good said professor grubbly-plank and professor <personname> set off back across the lawn to the castle
dyou realize <personname> and i are behind on homework again and it is only the second week
about me what
said <personname>
reparo <personname> muttered pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china
said <personname> eagerly
you did listen to what i said about a load of it being luck did not you
you are not still in contact with him are you
the sign creaked in the wind as they approached
what are they expecting
all of them however looked fixedly even eagerly at <personname>
what makes me say <personname>s back
i do not want to talk about <personname> all right
no said <personname> no okay i know i did bits of it without help but the point i am trying to make is  are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff
inquired george pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the zonkos bags
right said <personname> looking relieved that something had at last been settled
well then the next question is how often we do it
they are spirits of fire said <personname> her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever
library
for all that <personname> had said about study and homework groups being allowed he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious
no
<personname> made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face but her friend stood beside her arms folded clicking her tongue so that <personname> had little choice but to leave with her
but the more people the better really i mean michael corner and his friends would not have come if he had not been going out with <personname>  <personname> who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front
<personname> who of course was up to date with all her work brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her producing more hats and scarves
he had expected <personname> to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside hooting dolefully
<personname> knocked he heard footsteps and then the door opened and he found himself face-to-face with professor <personname>
er said <personname>
just a moment wilhelmina said professor <personname>
here he spotted <personname> and <personname> already standing in a sheltered corner their cloak collars turned up against the wind
he glanced sideways at <personname> and <personname> his eyebrows raised
i suggest you ask him said <personname> jerkily
yes the ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers er backgrounds she turned away walked over to pansy parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons
<personname> had already given them homework and he had quidditch practice this evening this would mean another couple of sleepless nights
i will pretend to be ill and do <personname>s essay instead then i will not have to stay up half the night you cannot skive off divination said <personname> severely
she just said she needed a bit of time to consider
she says you will be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined
certainly not said <personname> looking surprised
<personname>
<personname>s army <personname> has been reading your mail <personname>
you think <personname> attacked <personname>
i went to <personname> and i think she might have appealed to <personname> anyway <personname> had to give in
<personname> emerged from behind his towel the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses but he could still tell that everyone is face was turned toward him
he had been looking into <personname>s face his scar had hurt  and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach  a strange leaping feeling  a happy feeling but of course he had not recognized it for what it was as he had been feeling so miserable himself last time it was because he was pleased he said
he thought  something good was going to happen
he was furious he looked around at <personname> who was gaping at him
who had it now
mimbulus mimbletonia said <personname>s voice and <personname> came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room
as the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement if he could only open it  enter beyond  he stretched out his hand his fingertips were inches from it <personname> sir he awoke with a start
not really bad said <personname> yawning and rubbing his eyes
i have had worse
sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not but when it appears it is always equipped for the seekers needs
well  it is just that <personname>s plans are not always that safe
together with <personname> they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the hogs head and telling them where to meet that evening
<personname> reached out seized the brass handle pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below
what is this place
we once hid from <personname> in here remember george
he turned his back on it
i think we ought to elect a leader said <personname>
right said <personname> when she had sat down again shall we get practicing then
i did it said <personname> gleefully
she giggled
yeah it was said <personname> enthusiastically as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them
on these fake coins though the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting
i think you have got enough to be getting on with at the moment she said loftily
when slytherins some of them seventh years and considerably larger than he was muttered as they passed in the corridors got your bed booked in the hospital wing <personname>
they received a rousing welcome at the gryffindor table where everyone was wearing red and gold but far from raising <personname>s spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale he collapsed onto the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal
you are going to be fine
<personname> and <personname> are in the same mold <personname> assured her
come on now angelina looks like she is got just the keeper to beat she shoots she aaaah  bletchley the slytherin keeper had saved the goal he threw the quaffle to warrington who sped off with it zigzagging in between alicia and katie the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer <personname> <personname> is our king <personname> is our king he always let us the quaffle in <personname> is our king
and i think to be safe this young mans twin ought to be stopped too if his teammates had not restrained him i feel sure he would have attacked young mr <personname> as well
the rest of the team can continue playing i saw no signs of violence from any of them
well  good afternoon to you
only <personname> and <personname> were left beside the fire
what for
he picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face
giants
did not you know
i don know anything that is been happenin since i left
tell us about your summer and i will tell you about mine
you had to act like muggles all the way
said it was odds on he would sent a messenger off ter them already
skin like rhino hide an all
what dyou mean
whose head
there was a new gurg golgomath
she was rarin ter attack  them she is something when she is roused <personname> fiery you know  spect it is the french in her  <personname> gazed misty-eyed into the fire
<personname> allowed him thirty seconds reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly
asked <personname>
twice they stared directly into the corner where <personname> stood sandwiched between <personname> and <personname>
you ought to know too that as high inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers
don be silly i wouldn give you anythin dangerous i mean all righ they can look after themselves  <personname> you have got to pass <personname>s inspection and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs stuff like that said <personname> earnestly
gits  <personname> returned from <personname>s just before lunch shivering slightly her robes damp to the knees
<personname> remembered the only occasion on which <personname> had entered the forest before now he had not been very brave then either
course they are trained said <personname> scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder
now  put yer hands up who can see  them
an you too <personname> eh
for answer <personname> pointed at the cow carcass on the ground
the whole class stared at it for a few seconds then several people gasped and parvati squealed
they are supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them
<personname>s heart sank like a stone but <personname> merely chuckled
jus didn understand did they
<personname> had tears of fury in her eyes now
mazin senses of direction jus tell  them where you want ter go  assuming they can understand you of course said <personname> loudly and pansy parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles
they were so busy that <personname> had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three
all those poor elves i have not set free yet having to stay over during christmas because there are not enough hats <personname> who had not had the heart to tell her that <personname> was taking everything she made bent lower over his history of magic essay
space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once half the group observed the others for a while then swapped over
he was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak
wha
she shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve
<personname> felt a burning desire to run from the room and at the same time a complete inability to move his feet
yeah said <personname>
she was much too close
<personname> looked from <personname>s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to <personname>s slight frown and nodded
are you that bad at kissing
do not you understand how <personname>s feeling at the moment
well i suppose it could have been worse she said
we have got da meetings have not we
<personname> <personname>l he had to tell <personname> it was very important that he tell him taking great gulps of air <personname> pushed himself up in bed willing himself not to throw up again the pain half-blinding him
mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries <personname> was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back onto his nose
there was a pause in which <personname> leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling
<personname> watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed and after a few seconds the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air a serpents head grew out of the end of it opening its mouth wide
said professor <personname> pausing at the door
visit my other portrait
<personname> injured wife and children and <personname> coming to stay recited phineas in a bored voice
i had a a kind of vision and he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked rather than from behind the snakes own eyes <personname> who was still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak
we have got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right
mungos
we can all go and see him later
she inquired curiously as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart of the city
witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows asking questions and making notes on clipboards like <personname>s
hello he called throwing the prophet aside
should not he be in a private room
they have been talking to him this morning the healers you know trying to persuade him he will be able to lead an almost normal life
said mr <personname> with a significant smile at <personname>
<personname> and <personname> went in and closed the door of the ward behind them
i am the one <personname>s trying to use that is why they have got guards around me everywhere i go it is not for my protection it is for other peoples only it is not working they cannot have someone on me all the time at hogwarts i did attack mr <personname> last night it was me <personname> made me do it and he could be inside me listening to my thoughts right now are you all right <personname> dear
you look ever so pale are you sure you slept this morning
he stopped his pacing and stood staring at phineas nigelluss empty frame
we slytherins are brave yes but not stupid
oh i see said phineas nigellus still stroking his beard
he was sinking into shadows it was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start
<personname> asked her pulling open the door as buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he might have dropped
well to tell the truth skiings not really my thing said <personname>
so she sat down next to <personname> and the two girls and <personname> looked up at <personname>
then he turned on the spot to face her
you did not leave your bed mate said <personname>
<personname> flicked through the first volume eagerly he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the da <personname> had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device but unfortunately prevented <personname> putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off
said <personname> dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of <personname>s mother
so this is kreachers bedroom
er  i think we would better knock  <personname> rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply
well everyone had a good day
they told me they would not need doing until tomorrow
taught you everything you know i expect did i
a motherly looking healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor smiling warmly at <personname> and the others
<personname> looked rather startled that mrs <personname> knew her name but shook hands all the same
i yes <personname> dear what is it
the door closed behind them
<personname> did not want to leave <personname> all alone again with only kreacher for company
<personname>
now come on quickly he says he cannot stay long
the silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike
study what
<personname>s heart began to pump very fast indeed
you understand
<personname> had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting
extra lessons with <personname> what on earth had he done to deserve this
why cannot <personname> teach <personname>
he was rather taller than <personname> who <personname> noticed had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what <personname> was sure was the handle of his wand
well then you will know he is so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him <personname> said sleekly
that is great news really great yes is not it
<personname> asked
number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways squeezing it out of sight one blink later it had gone
bang
see you then  the six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunks
<personname> spent most of the next day dreading the evening
it is what everyone is going to think is not it
that i am really stup  hi <personname> said a voice behind him
we will be in the library <personname> said <personname> firmly and she seized <personname> above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase
for some reason she was looking rather embarrassed
<personname> did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself as he did so
sir
up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser
said <personname> urgently
<personname> pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and <personname> tensed in his chair but <personname> merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair
<personname> s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of <personname> s desk
he asked eyeing <personname> intently
<personname> said
<personname> whispered and then looking concerned are you all right <personname>
look let us get back to the common room well be a bit more comfortable there but the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement <personname> and george were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise
something goods happened mumbled <personname>
said <personname> and <personname> together
healers called to the scene were unable to revive mr bode who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death
i saw him at the ministry with your dad  <personname>s mouth fell open
you migh notve picked up on it bu that inspection didn go too well you know  anyway he sighed deeply
<personname> watched him go wondering how much more bad news he could stand
they sounded curious rather than hostile now and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the prophets version of how and why ten death eaters had managed to break out of azkaban fortress
said <personname> angrily
signed <personname> jane <personname> high inquisitor this latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students
he had not once mentioned his meeting with <personname> <personname> and <personname> on the closed ward in st
i am getting sick of my scar hurting and i am getting bored walking down that corridor every night
he used to be a death eater said <personname> stubbornly
and about time if it had not come today  she said eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment
they wandered toward dervish and banges
just do it he told himself as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest
if they would lived life would have bin differentrent eh
family said <personname> gloomily
he was still a few tables away when he realized that <personname> was not alone she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined <personname> and none other than <personname> ex journalist on the daily prophet and one of <personname>s least favorite people in the world
i thought you were with <personname> i was not expecting you for another hour at least <personname>
he feels angry of course said <personname> in a hard clear voice
the prophet exists to sell itself you silly girl she said coldly
you think people will take him seriously if he is published in the quibbler
<personname> did not say anything for a while but eyed <personname> shrewdly her head a little to one side
they do it because it is an honor and of course to see their names in print
well yes said <personname> calmly taking a sip of her drink
if zacharias smith beats us i might have to kill myself
maybe not she said darkly returning to her translation again but at least my happiness does not depend on <personname>s goalkeeping ability
it was not a very fast snitch and summerbys got a cold he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment
there is a difference
well i will save it for parties eh
<personname> got into bed thinking about the match
once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him her wide toads mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile
he turned his head slowly to the left
he knew he should not have seen the door but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with <personname> if he could have saved his snore for just another minute  k k k they entered the great hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on monday morning
<personname> was not the only person eagerly awaiting her daily prophet nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped death eaters who despite many reported sightings had still not been caught
in large red letters across his picture were the words <personname> speaks out at last the truth about <personname> and the night i saw him return it is good is not it
said <personname> who had drifted over to the gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between <personname> and <personname>
this one looks okay though said <personname> slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in paisley
how you dare  how you could  she took a deep breath
he cannot believe it he says people seem even more interested in this than the crumple horned snorkacks <personname> was a hero in the gryffindor common room that night daringly <personname> and george had put an enlargement charm on the front cover of the quibbler and hung it on the wall so that <personname>s giant head gazed down upon the proceedings occasionally saying things like the ministry are morons and eat dung <personname> in a booming voice
i do not blame you rookwood said <personname> in that cold cruel voice
well  avery is not he is in trouble he gave him the wrong information he is really angry <personname> groaned and sank shaking onto his bed rubbing his scar
<personname> saw it spill over his chin onto his chest
he said taken aback
the week did not improve as it progressed <personname> received two more ds in potions was still on tenterhooks that <personname> might get the sack and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in which he had seen <personname> though he did not bring it up with <personname> and <personname> again because he did not want another telling-off from <personname>
that is just as well <personname> said <personname> coldly because you are neither special nor important and it is not up to you to find out what the dark <personname> is saying to his death eaters
yes <personname> he said his eyes glinting
<personname> looked around at him frowning
the screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall they grew louder as <personname> ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dungeons
no this cannot be happening it cannot  i refuse to accept it you did not realize this was coming
<personname> and parvati were both crying silently their arms around each other
as high inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers
she turned a page of the newspaper scanning its columns
not very good poor thing said <personname> sympathetically
are not we going up to north tower
classroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the great hall
when he entered it right behind <personname> and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing he was therefore momentarily stunned
what oh comprehension dawned on her face
he wondered whether it had been bane who had kicked firenze in the chest
trivial hurts tiny human accidents said firenze as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor
<personname> repeated blankly
they had finally started work on patronuses which everybody had been very keen to practice though as <personname> kept reminding them producing a patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different to producing it when confronted by something like a dementor
it was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent
<personname> asked quietly
and it had been <personname>s very first meeting  and <personname> had been getting so good fizzing whizbee sang <personname> and the stone gargoyle jumped aside the wall behind split open and they ascended the moving stone staircase
all of them were watching what was happening below alert and serious
as <personname> entered a few flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors ears
yes yes do said <personname> nodding and he glanced maliciously at <personname> as <personname> left the room
if the first meeting was not illegal all those that have happened since most certainly are
do you have any evidence that these meetings continued
again marietta shook her head
he gazed at the heading scribbled by <personname> months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak
merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me
no professor <personname> be quiet <personname> or i am afraid you will have to leave my office said <personname> calmly
merlins beard no said <personname> smiling
<personname> <personname> kingsley and dawlish lay motionless on the floor
fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them singing softly
unfortunately i had to hex kingsley too or it would have looked very suspicious said <personname> in a low voice
a select group of students who are supportive of the ministry of magic hand-picked by professor <personname>
said <personname> smiling at her
anything to do with what
follow me <personname> glanced back at <personname> and <personname> who were both looking worried
he shrugged and followed <personname> back into the entrance hall against the tide of hungry students
she continued to scribble for a few moments
in that case you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of <personname>
mr <personname> said <personname> let me remind you that it was i who almost caught the criminal <personname> in the gryffindor fire in october
and mr <personname> is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle
sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord
<personname> and <personname> were standing apparently transfixed with horror halfway down the stairs
impressive <personname> said quietly grinning
<personname> and george were heroes that night in the gryffindor common room
he got into bed yawning
with a surge of guilt he realized that he had not practiced occlumency once since their last lesson there had been too much going on since <personname> had left
<personname> flushed and her eyes grew brighter
well we will soon find out will not we
the silver white contents were ebbing and swirling within
several people laughed
e he had been embellishing jumped to his feet stuffed his quill and the exam question paper into his bag which he slung over his back and stood waiting for <personname> to join him
a gang of chattering girls separated <personname> from <personname> and <personname> and by planting himself in the midst of this group <personname> managed to keep <personname> in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of <personname> and his friends
wormtail was watching him with his mouth open
look who it is <personname>s head turned
i was watching him his nose was touching the parchment said <personname> viciously
behind him the impediment jinx was wearing off
many people in the small crowd watching cheered
apologize to evans <personname> roared at <personname> his wand pointed threateningly at him
said <personname> trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him
no said <personname> getting to his feet as far from <personname> as he could
well i do not think <personname> should stop until you are absolutely sure you can control them said <personname> indignantly
<personname> had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left until their exams
nothing  he seized his copy of defensive magical theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index
<personname> i am talking to you can you hear me
well we are not sure but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat
he was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of st
are you insane
<personname> awoke very early the next day feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his hearing at the ministry of magic
<personname> watched the cabin for several minutes
at the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask corked it and took it up to <personname>s desk for marking feeling that he might at last have scraped an e he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise <personname> gave a gleeful yell of laughter
professor <personname> was sitting there a clipboard on her knee a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small horribly smug smile on her face
professor <personname>s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing
unless you are prepared to take even more exams after hogwarts you should really look at another   which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an auror as <personname> has of ever returning to this school
dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him he pulled open his bag seized <personname>s knife and donned the invisibility cloak
he inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down then withdrew it
are you all right
he kept messing up his hair said <personname> in a pained voice
he said
he grew out of it
yeah said <personname> surprised at what he considered a great overreaction
prominent among the onlookers were members of the inquisitorial squad who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves and peeves who was bobbing overhead gazed down upon <personname> and george who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered
they turned left streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor
twice he shut mrs norris inside suits of armor from which she was rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker
said <personname> in a satisfied voice
because they got the gold from me
he had been regretting this ever since <personname> would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when <personname> least expected it
the problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to studying his mind seemed saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all
he told <personname> and <personname> grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match
and he is scored
you you will see in a mo said <personname> looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them
when he realized they were no longer with him he turned
he had half the herd onto him  and you stopped it
<personname>
any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence
maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen so i can  fill you in said <personname>
an <personname> if he is willin
sure enough <personname> could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work
small
in front of <personname> and <personname> meanwhile the gigantic <personname> was rising from the ground which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him
he had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it toward him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go
ony it is a difficult name fer him ter remember no not at all squeaked <personname>
the trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged behind him
bane gave no sign that he had ever seen <personname> before
said <personname> testily
firenze has betrayed and dishonored us
i do not know how you work that out said <personname> impatiently
i reckon it is over you know said <personname> still squinting toward the stadium
i do not know  <personname> is our king <personname> is our king he did not let the quaffle in <personname> is our king  and i wish they would stop singing that stupid song said <personname> miserably have not they gloated enough
at the front doors both instinctively looked back at the forbidden forest
they spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while <personname> talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time
he said faintly looking from one to the other
and <personname> wants us to
i mean come on  we have got exams and we are about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a millimeter apart from being chucked out as it is
grans always telling professor marchbanks i am not as good as my dad well  you saw what she is like at st
not anymore said <personname>
well he thought at least he would be sure of one bit of post next summer their first exam theory of charms was scheduled for monday morning
why do not you just do it yourself
meanwhile <personname> was reading two years of charms notes with his fingers in his ears his lips moving soundlessly <personname> was lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a substantive charm while dean checked it against the standard book of spells grade 5 and parvati and <personname> who were practicing basic locomotion charms were making their pencil cases race each other around the edge of the table
is that the examiners
<personname>s name was called
said <personname>
for a bonus point
only four exams left said parvati patil wearily as they headed back to gryffindor common room
he might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading saying it looked to him as though professor marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous tuesday
he could not think why <personname> would be taking a stroll outside past midnight much less accompanied by five others
he could feel professor marchbankss eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago but as professor marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the astronomy tower
<personname>s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to stun him
but why sack <personname> now
you may begin <personname> stared fixedly at the first question
maybe <personname> is just someone <personname> does not care about seeing hurt  you know what i have just thought of something said <personname> in a hushed voice
there is no need to take that tone with me she said coolly
so <personname> you go and head <personname> off <personname> <personname> if you can start moving people out of the corridor <personname> and i will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear <personname> strode away his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage
the garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine warming their plates but otherwise the office was as still and empty as last time
it is the <personname> boys head in the fire kreacher informed the empty kitchen stealing furtive oddly triumphant glances at <personname>
where is he gone
<personname>
i had stealth sensoring spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in you foolish boy
no one  said <personname> trying to pull away from her
ah professor <personname> said <personname> smiling widely and standing up again
said <personname> showing his first faint sign of interest as he looked around at <personname>
they were all bleating about silencing you somehow discrediting you but i was the one who actually did something about it only you wriggled out of that one did not you <personname>
little miss question-all is going to give us some answers come on then girl come on er my nee no shouted <personname> through his gag
weapon
lead on fight and flight <personname> had no idea what <personname> was planning or even whether she had a plan
he did not dare attempt to talk to her <personname> was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing
the sound of their wild neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving
they are young said a slow doleful voice from behind <personname>
no they got chased off by <personname> said <personname>
it was all supposed to be about fighting <personname> was not it
<personname> was already in place sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day
<personname> did not think he had ever moved so fast the thestral streaked over the castle its wide wings hardly beating
they were descending at last he heard one of the girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body presumably they had received a shock from the change of position just as he had and now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides
she asked <personname> in a politely interested voice as though this was all a rather interesting day trip
okay listen said <personname> stopping again within six feet of the door
we will not need to get out till we have found <personname>  do not go calling for him though <personname> said urgently but <personname> had never needed her advice less his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being
unsupported by any surrounding wall the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched
there were faint whispering murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil
i do not know but whatever it was it was dangerous she said firmly again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door
she pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said alohomora nothing happened
he could not hear anything nor see the slightest sign of movement
but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the atrium above and the others accusing stares have you seen this
said <personname> but eagerly this time it had to be a sign that <personname> had been there a clue he strode back to where they were all standing a little way down row ninety-seven but found nothing except <personname> staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves
the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor run <personname> yelled and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above he seized a handful of <personname>s robes and dragged her forward one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them
the door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead <personname> could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through it the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them  colloportus gasped <personname> and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise
but even as they watched their mouths open the head began to swell to its previous proportions again thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin it is time said <personname> in an awestruck voice
the death eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar
we are right next to that circular room if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more death eaters come i will bet you can get <personname> up the corridor and into the lift then you could find someone raise the alarm  and whad are you going do do
next moment his knees had given way but he still clutched the front of <personname>s robes so that <personname> was pulled into a kind of bow
what happened
<personname> can you help <personname>

he dodged her and sprinted back up the room he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy hey said <personname> who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward <personname> giggling
<personname> look what is happen no no i do not like it no stop stop  but the thin ribbons were spinning around <personname>s chest now
diffindol yelled <personname> trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around <personname> before his eyes but they would not break
now <personname> either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way <personname> did not have to think there was no choice
the death eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the order who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor through the darting bodies the flashes of light <personname> could see <personname> crawling along
a brain addacked <personname> bud i dink he is all righd and herbiones unconscious bud we could feel a bulse  there was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais
she killed <personname> bellowed <personname>
she screamed cruciol and he was forced to duck down again as the centaurs arm holding its bow spun off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizards head
your dear old mate <personname> knows it is gone he is not going to be happy with you is he
but master he is here he is below  <personname> paid no attention
meanwhile the goblin and the house elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at <personname> who vanished and reappeared beside the pool
but even as he shouted one more jet of green light had flown at <personname> from <personname>s wand and the snake had struck fawkes swooped down in front of <personname> opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole
as <personname> pulled him back to his feet <personname> saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking <personname> forward
we can discuss that after i have sent <personname> back to hogwarts said <personname>
everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmasters absence
he did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it a picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said ah  <personname>  phineas nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arms as he watched <personname> with shrewd narrow eyes
to say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable
oh good said the wizard
holds you in great esteem
<personname> could not stand this he could not stand being <personname> anymore he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else the empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame making <personname> leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate
i know how you are feeling <personname> said <personname> very quietly
he wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him that hatefully calm old face
he was shaking from head to foot
he would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for <personname> through the house <personname> i owe you an explanation said <personname>
why i did not teach you occlumency
he could see now that <personname> looked sad and tired
on those rare occasions when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes i was trying in distancing myself from you to protect you
<personname>s aim in possessing you as he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction
he paused
he croaked
i thought professor <personname> could overcome his feelings about your father i was wrong
he had no love for kreacher because kreacher was a living reminder of the home <personname> had hated
but i knew too where <personname> was weak
i put my trust therefore in your mothers blood
wait a moment
you sent that howler
it did said <personname> quietly
and then  well you will remember the events of your first year at hogwarts quite as clearly as i do
you did more
eleven i told myself was much too young to know
i should have recognized that i was too happy to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young
i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid
what did i care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy
the sun had risen fully now
but when sibyll trelawney spoke it was not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tones <personname> had heard her use once before
the other was <personname> <personname>
he might have marked the wrong person he chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said <personname>
he chose not the pureblood which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the half-blood like himself
said <personname> who felt numb and cold
and that interview with <personname> is not exclusive it is the one that was in the quibbler months ago daddy sold it to them said <personname> vaguely turning a page of the quibbler
but he left a tiny patch under the window and he is roped it off  why
oh he just says it was a really good bit of magic said <personname> shrugging
since she had returned to the castle she had not as far as any of them knew uttered a single word
and ask him what is happening about  about his little friend <personname> gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory
i see there are no longer any points left in the gryffindor hourglass to take away
he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at <personname> and <personname>
<personname> knew from the look of concern on <personname>s face that he was not referring to <personname>s physical well being
indeed professor <personname> sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after <personname> herself because peeves had borrowed her walking stick
he had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he was going to see <personname> talk to him again disappointment was burning in his throat
why does not everyone come back
he had turned the corner toward the fat ladys corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall
how come you are not at the feast
<personname> looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully
i was nine
you mean  in that room with the archway
<personname> stood just behind him her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass station ceiling wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple t-shirt bearing the legend the weird sisters
he said so loudly that passersby actually turned to stare
it could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path
keep in touch
i  oh  very well said the prime minister weakly
i will only bother you if there is something really serious going on our end something that is likely to affect the muggles the non-magical population i should say
it had been his last desperate hope
to the prime ministers dismay however the portrait had proved impossible to remove
when several carpenters a builder or two an art historian and the chancellor of the exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall the prime minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office
fve just come from azkaban <personname> had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket
a mass breakout
it was however eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge
and  and we suspect giant involvement
<personname> cleared his throat and with an effort it seemed stopped spinning his bowler hat
killed in a room that was locked from the inside was not she
rufus scrimgeour minister of magic
there were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp
i would rather not be interrupted said scrimgeour shortly or watched he added pointing his wand at the windows so that the curtains swept across them
first of all we need to discuss your security
said scrimgeour coldly
the one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck
what about him
the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon
<personname> she said curtly as she passed him
she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but <personname> forestalled her
but not by you said <personname> furiously
no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not <personname>
they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled <personname>
you understand how the enchantment works i think
you have not done it
indeed many of the dark <personname>s old followers thought <personname> might be a standard around which we could all rally once more
now  you came to ask me for help <personname>
it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice
he failed to hear the prophecy
listen to me
<personname>s expression was blank unreadable
<personname> lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite <personname>
she drew it still looking astonished
i will said <personname>
page 3 column 2 to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students safety was visible
particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness
5
they may have been put under the imperius curse see page 4
should the dark mark appear over any dwelling place or other building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately

hoping to see you this friday i am yours most sincerely <personname> though he already knew it by heart <personname> had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven of the clock that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive
i do not mean to be rude  he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable
ah and this must be <personname>
yes said <personname>
our problem he continued to <personname> as if there had been no interruption is that <personname> also left you number twelve grimmauld place
no he said
after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt <personname> whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum
not if you do not want to said <personname>
<personname> has been looking after him since <personname> died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements  no said <personname> at once he can stay with <personname>
as you will no doubt be aware <personname> comes of age in a years time  no said aunt <personname> speaking for the first time since <personname>s arrival
said <personname> politely
no he does not
the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that <personname> has powerful protection while he can still call this house home
but i think i might prefer brooms
oh i think we will find a use for you said <personname> vaguely
she was a great witch
he had pointed with his injured hand
yes i received one myself said <personname> still smiling
inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since <personname> was last powerful
<personname> followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink
a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword
weak chest
demanded slughorn
but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life
said slughorn
slughorn s watery eyes slid over <personname>s scar this time taking in the rest of his face
i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house
thought she must have been pure-blood she was so good
upset stomach
he will undoubtedly try to collect you <personname>
professor <personname> <personname> and no you will not
very well then said <personname> pushing open the broom she would door and stepping out into the yard
<personname> your servant
here you are  she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward <personname> and tipped over mrs <personname> slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup
he was at hogwarts for ages started around the same time as <personname> i think
that is great he gasped
i do not think it can be just our family  but i do not know anyone else who is got a clock like this so i cannot check
i still do not see why we have to go through that every time you come home said mrs <personname> still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak
all the hands were once again at mortal peril
there was something hard inside the pillowcase
he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss <personname>s death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said what is the time
oh said <personname> looking disappointed
you did
yeah that will work said <personname> sarcastically
<personname> who was now helping himself to <personname>s toast was still gazing dreamily at the door
and what about <personname>
cannot be long now it is been a month said <personname>
i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back  <personname> will you shut up you are not the only one who is nervous barked <personname>
he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside
well we are newt students now grinned <personname>
he had known all along that he would not but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black e it was odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told <personname> he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he could not really think of anything else he would like to be
6 dracos detour <personname> remained within the confines of the burrows garden over the next few weeks
and they have found <personname>s body in a shack up north
do not get used to it it is only because of <personname> said mr <personname> over his shoulder
he and mrs <personname> were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa
yes but do not go arresting anyone now dear we are in a hurry said mrs <personname> nervously consulting a list
put those away she said coldly to <personname> and <personname>
you will be in such trouble
watch where you are putting your pins woman mother i do not think i want these anymore  he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam malkins feet
don worry abou them
he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts <personname> noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf
the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued
our feetll be seen said <personname> anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays
we can said <personname> excitedly
well i would better be off
and do not forget to keep that one safe i will need it
what was that about
but <personname> had already ducked out from under the cloak
as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign
what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on <personname>s face as he had left the shop
she was sitting on the windowsill in <personname> and georges room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation
he is been branded with the dark mark
i think he just wanted to get out of there <personname> said <personname>
i am not sure <personname>
we cannot <personname> said <personname> looking apologetic
you would better get straight on the train all of you you have only got a few minutes to go said mrs <personname> consulting her watch
i think he is been branded with the dark mark
i doubt it to be honest <personname> said mr <personname> slowly
you see when <personname> was arrested we raided his house
he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the <personname>sen one rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight
you did
he is just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed
asked <personname> nervously as though he was expecting detention
the exception was <personname> who darted into her compartment when she saw <personname> coming
at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door
oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at <personname> who was glaring at zabini around slughorn s great belly
anyway said slughorn turning back to <personname>
said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into <personname>s foot
who else had he invited
zabini shrugged
pansy was gazing down at <personname> as though she had never seen anything so awe inspiring
i just want to check something
<personname> felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere
he thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the far-off hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where <personname> had gone
from what <personname> could see in the darkness she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at the burrow
alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened
<personname> felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that <personname> could not feel them burning him
they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hall
we have been terrified i will tell you later said <personname> curtly
of course <personname> would spread the story as far and wide as he could but there was always a chance it would not reach too many gryffindor ears
said <personname> between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau
him and everyone else here sniffed <personname>
we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year
potions
he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed
that slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term
<personname> <personname> and <personname> were not the only ones who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that <personname> had finally achieved his hearts desire
now as everybody in this hall knows <personname> and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength
pip pip with the usual deafening scraping noise the benches were moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitories
come on <personname> he was just showing off for parkinson
<personname> uses that name said <personname> stubbornly
he is got a new home up in the mountains now <personname> fixed it nice big cave
really
we are going to need that time for studying <personname> said <personname> as they set off down the corridor
hold it said <personname> throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand
it is high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she is got rather than the one she thinks she ought to have particularly after what happened at the ministry
i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark <personname> very pleased
now why have not you applied to continue with potions
look said <personname> delightedly gazing at his schedule we have got a free period now  and a free period after break  and after lunch  excellent
i thought you would get that well done she called over pointing at the captains badge on <personname>s chest
crookshankss yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close
a fifteen inch essay two translations and i have got to read these by wednesday shame yawned <personname>
the classroom door opened as she spoke and <personname> stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair
nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures
here let me show you  he turned his wand on <personname> so fast that <personname> reacted instinctively all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten he yelled protegol his shield charm was so strong <personname> was knocked off-balance and hit a desk
the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying
that was brilliant <personname> chortled <personname> once they were safely on their way to break a short while later
s
good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old da lags  and how are you <personname> <personname>
scales out everyone and potion kits and do not forget your copies of advanced potion-making
said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as <personname>s hand punched the air again
and the steam rising in characteristic spirals said <personname> enthusiastically and it is supposed to smell differently to each of us according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and  but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence
can you possibly be related to hector dagworth-granger who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers
whether he was playacting or not thought <personname> the effect was good
it could not have been clearer that <personname> really wanted that lucky day
<personname>s potion he gave an approving nod
well it was not exactly your own work was it
it is nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice
it is five to eight i would better go i will be late for <personname>
ah good evening <personname>
there was a pause
sir said <personname> tentatively does what you are going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy
that is neither here nor there said ogden coldly and <personname> felt his respect for ogden rise
perhaps we could continue this discussion inside
who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere
he bellowed at ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while merope spluttered and gasped for breath
it is clear from your sons attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions
could not your father have that hovel cleared away <personname>
darling  whispered morfin in parseltongue looking at his sister
what did you say morfin
merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak
oh she survived said <personname> reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that <personname> should sit down too
i think you are forgetting said <personname> that merope was a witch
personally i am inclined to think that she used a love potion
instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done
but she did have his baby
but how come
have you always had it
a few days before i came to fetch you from your aunt and uncles in fact
<personname>s helping hand as <personname> had predicted the sixth years free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation <personname> had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set
we have got quidditch tryouts this morning said <personname>
oh come on <personname> said <personname> suddenly impatient
everyone knows you have been telling the truth now do not they
mr shunpike 21 was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his clapham home   stan shunpike a death eater
they had not seen hannah since
most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks
if there is anyone else here who is not from gryffindor roared <personname> who was starting to get seriously annoyed leave now please there was a pause then a couple of little ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter
<personname> looked around expecting to see <personname> but it was <personname>
he is still a bit scary is not he
<personname> said <personname> sounding shocked
reckon i am lonely or summat
yeah
if you ask me said <personname> quietly mclaggen looks like he was confunded this morning
i doubt you will be alone <personname> will probably be invited snapped <personname> who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by slughorn
not really  <personname> had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages
someone is sent it to him by owl then he said
really stumped this time <personname> found nothing else to say
no  from professor <personname> said demelza
because it is probably not ministry of magic approved said <personname>
said <personname> and <personname> together
they were abusing it
if he would been a budding death eater he would not have been boasting about being half-blood would he
there is no way they would let me be a death eater said <personname> indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at <personname> and hitting ernie macmillan on the head
i am going with dean might see you there she replied waving at them as she left
go and sit down i will get you a drink
the other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed
once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them rearranged their scarves pulled on their gloves then followed katie bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the high street
scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on
<personname> he panted disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen
who is bin cursed not <personname>
the label said it was cursed
oh no oh no i bet she would been imperiused and i did not realize leanne shook with renewed sobs
she rose up in the air said <personname> before either <personname> or <personname> could speak and then began to scream and collapsed
this was a life-and-death matter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at
it was not a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it said <personname> casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down
not what you would call foolproof
but she could do magic said <personname> impatiently
ah said <personname> perhaps she could
mrs cole simply gaped
it soon became clear that mrs cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking
and she was dead in another hour
anything about the boys father for instance
and then when he got a little older he was  odd
i think he must be said mrs cole frowning slightly but it is very hard to catch him at it
said <personname>
they looked reasonably well-cared for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up
<personname>
he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer
always i knew there was something
<personname> threw <personname> a long clear calculating look
open it said <personname>
yes sir said <personname> again
i can help you find everything  you are coming with me
asked <personname> looking up
there are a lot of <personname>s muttered <personname>
he was called <personname> too they have told me
so when i have got all my stuff when do i come to this hogwarts
<personname> got to his feet and held out his hand again
i shall see you at hogwarts
i think that will do said the white-haired <personname> at <personname>s side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the present-day office
i mean he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit and he absolutely fawns on mclaggen because he is so well-connected but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to gwenog jones
personally i thought she was a bit full of herself but  quite enough chat over here said professor sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern
pass me a bowl said <personname> holding the pulsating pod at arms length <personname> handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face
<personname> groaned
reparo he said hastily poking the pieces with his wand and the bowl sprang back together again
although <personname> watched his two friends more closely over the next few days <personname> and <personname> did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual
just because i do not do it in public  <personname> screamed with derisive laughter trying to push <personname> out of the way
demelza pull yourself together you played really well today
bending low so that only <personname> could hear her she hissed you should be expelled for that
<personname> smiled back vaguely but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from quidditch
a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been lee jordans <personname> recognized zacharias smith a hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked
oi harper yelled <personname> in desperation
there really was not anything in my pumpkin juice
looking for <personname>
with a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight
<personname> could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this
she walked very slowly and erectly toward the door
it is tomorrow night they are getting desperate
she looked as though she might have a seizure <personname> who had hastily packed her things grabbed <personname> by the arm and frogmarched him away
they had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration working in front of mirrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows
i thought at first it was <personname> in there but it turned out to be <personname>
i will get <personname> to put it right for me
yes i am meeting cormac at eight and we are  there was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and <personname> surfaced
no said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip
did you hear there is supposed to be a vampire coming
yes he is a vampire said <personname> matter-of-factly
a gaggle of girls was standing close to him looking curious and excited
and all with very little effort on your part i assure you ask sanguini here if it is not quite sanguini stay here added worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye
i have got no plans to tell <personname> anything about what might or might not have happened at keeper tryouts
and why was <personname> looking at <personname> as though both angry and  was it possible
<personname> pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices
nah he cannot have
mind your own business
well let us get going then george
he hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say as he marshaled his thoughts celestina warbeck began a ballad called you charmed the heart right out of me
it is left me for a spell  has it occurred to you <personname> said mr <personname> that <personname> was simply pretending
we both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion
who wants eggnog
and it is hard to argue with grey back out there
<personname>s hands closed convulsively in his lap
he plans it all
is this a title you are thinking of adopting
<personname> fell asleep almost immediately but <personname> delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of advanced potion-making before getting into bed
<personname>s presents included a sweater with a large golden snitch worked onto the front hand-knitted by mrs <personname> a large box of <personname>s wizard wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading to master from kreacher
ow orrible said <personname> with an affected little shudder
<personname> took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly sometimes  a great shock  an emotional upheaval  it looked big and it had four legs said <personname> struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice
<personname> and i were in the vicinity working you know and he could not resist dropping in and seeing you all
but <personname> showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family
he was not fooled for all scrimgeours talk that they had just been in the area that <personname> wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that scrimgeour could speak to <personname> alone
people believe you are the <personname>sen one you see said scrimgeour
<personname> felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so <personname> <personname> was still at the ministry was she
she gave a watery chuckle and stood back
there is a new password she said
no thanks i said i would meet dean said <personname> though <personname> could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic
nothing special
<personname> frowned trying to remember
please sign below if you would like to participate
<personname> grinned
and now <personname> i must insist that we press on
the knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance
nearly all were most favorably impressed by him
he told me  the <personname> who came out of that diary said <personname> never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did
<personname> frowned
morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support
so the ministry called upon morfin
he will kill me for losing it he told his captors over and over again
we shall be back before you know it
admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it was odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that <personname> had asked a question and failed to get an answer
but surely sir he said keeping his voice as respectful as possible you do not need me you could use legilimency  or veritaserum
today <personname> moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to ernie and ignored both <personname> and <personname>
she asked through gritted teeth
yes <personname> yes if you have got a bezoar to hand of course that would do the trick  although as they do not work on everything and are pretty rare it is still worth knowing how to mix antidotes
there was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around terrified to see susan bones of hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started
within five minutes they were climbing through the portrait hole
big birthday treat  three lessons on apparition was proving as difficult as ever though a few more people had managed to splinch themselves
happy birthday <personname> said <personname> when they were woken on the first of march by <personname> and dean leaving noisily for breakfast
might make it easier i suppose  <personname> looked thoughtfully at the box of <personname>colate cauldrons then shrugged and helped himself to a third
well all right i will come down with you sighed <personname> but i do not want to eat
they stared at each other for almost a whole minute before <personname> said this is a joke right
i offered you one did not i
i am going to let you down now okay
for a moment <personname> beamed at them
how exactly did it happen <personname>
then the poisoner did not know slughorn very well said <personname> speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold
they all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring
of course she added broodingly that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they do not seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim
wha worries me said <personname> lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder <personname> for good measure checked the ceiling for peeves is how long hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein attacked
shhhh said <personname> looking both nervous and angry
all the heads of houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business  yeah but <personname> s not having rows with the rest of them is he
it might even be that <personname> did not want anything to distract <personname> from their lessons or from procuring that memory from slughorn
yeah i think so
i met <personname> <personname> told her quietly as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head
then cadwallader scored again making things level but <personname> did not seem to have noticed she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score and kept attempting to draw the crowds attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that zacharias smith who had so far failed to maintain possession of the quaffle for longer than a minute was suffering from something called losers lurgy
she bustled back into her office and <personname> sank back into his pillows fuming
<personname> lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging
how come
after a while madam pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown
then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on
then there was another loud bang and peeves the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves
yes <personname> said <personname> at once his great eyes shining with excitement
tonight he told <personname> and <personname> once he had unrolled it
i cannot remember enjoying commentary more what is this by the way
and why was she with you
between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle
silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence <personname> had ever experienced with <personname> it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of armando dippet over <personname> s head
you remember where that was
<personname> repeated stunned
said hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror
help yourself <personname> said hepzibah i know how you love my cakes
she asked batting her lashes
will you promise you will not tell mr burke i have got it
hokey where are you
here madam squeaked the house-elf and <personname> saw two leather boxes one on top of the other moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables pouffes and footstools
the locket maybe said <personname> but why take the cup as well
nevertheless <personname> felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly <personname>s refusal to use <personname>s chosen name was a refusal to allow <personname> to dictate the terms of the meeting and <personname> could tell that <personname> took it as such
i am surprised you have remained here so long said <personname> after a short pause
i have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach
said <personname>
<personname> raised his eyebrows
he did not say
<personname> had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test
tm telling you the stupid prince is not going to be able to help you with this <personname> said <personname> more loudly
that is why i am looking for something different
you are going about it the wrong way said <personname>
<personname> let out a little shriek <personname> spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and <personname> said kreacher the house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes
<personname> still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters
no it is not said <personname> at once
he needed the room to become the headquarters of the da so it did
you have done brilliantly <personname>
you would better go and get some sleep too <personname>
thank you <personname> sir squeaked <personname> happily and he too vanished
i heard him telling <personname> it was not <personname>s business what he was doing  so what is he telling all these  all these  <personname>s voice tailed away he was staring at the fire
a hideout
i have already told you you need to persuade slughorn said <personname>
three times he walked past the door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eyes and faced it but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall
okay said <personname> aloud
okay  i thought the wrong thing
i need to see the place where <personname> keeps coming secretly
frustrated and annoyed he set off for defense against the dark arts pulling off his invisibility cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went
here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor
he spun around one-legged and toppled over
hey you do not know where he goes i suppose
yep said <personname>
i wondered whether it had not become  you know  him
said <personname>
he said
what on earth is more important than this memory <personname>
i have heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away
what was the werewolfs name
it is all about stopping <personname> is not it
and you too said <personname> with a significant look as <personname> headed off to the dungeons
when the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the forbidden forest they decided the moment had come and after checking carefully that <personname> dean and <personname> were all in the common room sneaked up to the boys dormitory
<personname> did not answer for a moment
right  i am going down to <personname>s
good evening professor
the forest
<personname> started to cry again
fang who had been skulking in his basket during the burial now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into <personname>s lap as usual
tiny little thing he was when he hatched
gets pulled out of their tails they catch it on branches an stuff in the forest you know  but my dear chap do you know how much that is worth
but i have found out pretty much what happened since
it is not a question  if it were to help you of course  but no purpose can be served  it can said <personname> clearly
i need information
slughorn and <personname> stared at each other over the guttering candle
thank you very much professor
by the time he got up to the portrait of the fat lady and pulled off his invisibility cloak he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood
he wheeled about and sprinted off again ignoring the fat lady who was calling after him
no you will go far <personname> i have never been wrong about a student yet
merlins beard <personname> yelped slughorn
then you told me two years later that on the night that <personname> returned to his body he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his death eaters
said <personname> startled
you would certainly have been that
i am sure that he was intending to make his final horcrux with your death
so  are you still looking for them sir
it was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once
he killed my mum and dad you are protected in short by your ability to love said <personname> loudly
sorry  looks like we have all got horrible dandruff now
ah said <personname>
keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could he asked how come
what dyou mean
if i talked to him first he would hit you
the last thing i remember was walking into the ladies in the three broomsticks
more out of habit than anything <personname> made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor checking the marauders map as he went
i cannot
once in the corridor he broke into a run toward gryffindor tower
here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor
a minute later he was back in front of <personname> who held out his hand wordlessly for <personname>s schoolbag
i understand what a nickname is said <personname>
but he had never learned how to do it properly
perhaps if they won <personname> and dean would make up during the post-match euphoria
the thought went through <personname> like an icy knife
and get the book
by saturday morning whatever he might have told <personname> <personname> would have gladly exchanged all the felix felicis in the world to be walking down to the quidditch pitch with <personname> <personname> and the others
on one such evening when <personname> had retired to the library and <personname> was sitting beside the window in the common room supposedly finishing his herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with <personname> at lunchtime <personname> dropped into the seat between him and <personname> with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face
you think she was the half-blood
everything went pitch black and the next thing i knew i was being hurled headfirst out of the room and you did not see that coming
the headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me she said coldly
the lightning-struck tower she whispered
calamity
<personname>
<personname> was standing stock still as waves of shock crashed over him wave after wave obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long
<personname> and <personname> together had sent <personname> hunting after <personname> and <personname> and their son
she looked alarmed as he ran past her around the corner into <personname>s corridor where the lone gargoyle stood sentry
where is it
you have no idea of the remorse professor <personname> felt when he realized how <personname> had interpreted the prophecy <personname>
if i tell you to flee you will obey
<personname> says he is put extra protection in the school but if <personname> s involved he will know what <personname> s protection is and how to avoid it but he will not be expecting you lot to be on the watch will he
er why do i need socks
and he was off hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall
you can apparate now i believe
here he said
did you think that would happen sir
only if we are very unfortunate
his thoughts were all of water monsters of giant serpents of demons kelpies and sprites
<personname> tapped the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls pulling something from the depths of the black water
magic always leaves traces said <personname> as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive traces
i think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not <personname>
we shall see whether he is right
oh  right  said <personname> quickly
this being the case <personname> it will be your job to make sure i keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth
i all right but  before <personname> could make any further protest <personname> lowered the crystal goblet into the potion
his face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream
i do not want to
<personname> drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled kill me this this one will gasped <personname>
no said <personname> shaking <personname> no you are not dead you said it was not poison wake up wake up rennervatel he cried his wand pointing at <personname>s chest there was a flash of red light but nothing happened
a slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him slowly backward across the rock
<personname> was on his feet again pale as any of the surrounding inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eyes his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames like a vast lasso encircling them all with warmth
once they were both safely jammed inside again the boat began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface
do not worry i will get us back
the archway will have sealed again
my knife  there is no need i got cut on the rock said <personname> firmly
just tell me where
the the dark mark <personname>
there was no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body
<personname> asked <personname> looking up at the green skull with its serpents tongue glinting evilly above them
in the dim green glow from the mark <personname> saw <personname> clutching at his chest with his blackened hand
they met some of your guards
it is you who should be scared but why
everyone thought it was a really good story but i was the only one who realized what it meant even borgin did not know i was the one who realized there could be a way into hogwarts through the cabinets if i fixed the broken one
<personname> demanded
but am i to take it then that nobody has been murdered
my options said <personname> loudly
but now at last we can speak plainly to each other
no harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived
this is most unusual
but <personname>s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim
looking around he saw <personname>s pale round face flat against the floor
he did not know what it was but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse another flash shouts retaliatory jets of light and <personname> understood <personname> had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the death eaters escaping and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire <personname> sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said not <personname>  not <personname> too  something caught <personname> hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostrils he knew even as he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him
fight back you cowardly  coward did you call me <personname>
you all righ
the crowd murmured behind <personname>
she stared at him for a moment then swayed alarmingly madam pomfrey who seemed to have pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under <personname>
i still do not know how the death eaters can possibly have entered
we did not know what was going on upstairs <personname> had taken the map
what would happen to it next
mr <personname> asked professor <personname> distractedly
like everybody else he was waiting for the explosion
and the meaning of <personname>s patronus and her mouse colored hair and the reason she had come running to find <personname> when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by greyback all suddenly became clear to <personname> it had not been <personname> that <personname> had fallen in love with after all
i have  i have done it professor he choked
i would like you to join us too
it had been here in this very room that <personname> had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but <personname> and <personname>
<personname> <personname> registered the renewed use of his surname in the light of professor <personname>s death i think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat i do not think so said <personname> shrugging
well said squeaked professor flitwick
said <personname> at once
he felt no curiosity at all about rab he doubted that he would ever feel curious again
so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said <personname> happily plumping up <personname>s pillows because ze british overcook their meat i ave always said this
ugly though he added hastily as <personname> raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle
they are still looking for <personname> but no sign  of course there is not said <personname> who became angry every time this subject cropped up
<personname> must have been proud of being half a prince you see
he did not really need legilimency
anyway the book was left in <personname>s old classroom and i will bet <personname> knew his mother was called prince
i thought the prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor but i would never have guessed he was a potential killer
hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of <personname> between them bossing them around
at the sight of the centaur firenze who was standing like a sentinel near the waters edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away
he was not the only one many heads were turning searching a little alarmed
the centaurs had come to pay their respects too
i care said <personname>
i knew you would not be happy unless you were hunting <personname>
rufus scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the bank leaning on his walking stick
there were also two broomsticks up there
he is gone
i would be delighted to place a couple of my aurors at your service  <personname> laughed
but it will be a short visit and then i will be gone for good
but mate you are going to have to come round my mum and dads house before we do anything else even godrics hollow
the prime minister felt it himself people really did seem more miserable than usual
however a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement
the prime minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all
the brockdale bridge  the bones and vance murders  not to mention the ruckus in the west country  you er your i mean to say some of your people were were involved in those those things were they
he remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day
it had been his last desperate hope
but said the prime minister breathlessly watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech but why why has nobody told me
occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning or else scratching his nose even once or twice simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind
anyway i had to come to you prime minister
repeated the prime minister hoarsely
whatever the press and the opposition might say the prime minister was not a foolish man
when you say back  he is alive
are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that
well of course they are he said
and they are breeding
there was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness the prime minister thought he understood why the wizarding community preferred scrimgeour to <personname> as a leader in these dangerous times
first of all we need to discuss your security
the prime minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied i am perfectly happy with the security i have already got thank you very  well we are not scrimgeour cut in
it will be a poor lookout for the muggles if their prime minister gets put under the imperius curse
you cannot just put your people into my office i decide who works for me  i thought you were happy with shacklebolt
it is addled his brains but he could still be dangerous
but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river
he lives here
together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze
yes of course
<personname> poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters
what have you been doing all these years that you have lived in <personname>s pocket
and why <personname> is <personname> still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years
i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon <personname>
he would have me said <personname> passionately
think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing <personname> to think that i was only returning to the dark <personname>s side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on <personname> and the order of the phoenix ever since consider <personname> the dark mark had been growing stronger for months
you could have killed him at any point in the past five years
<personname> is in jail and  she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids
will you speak to him persuade him
he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying when <personname> said nothing <personname> seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed
are not you listening <personname>
and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm
the headline of one blared <personname> the <personname>sen one
once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but <personname> was too deeply asleep to hear her
should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once
an alarm clock repaired by <personname> several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven
it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the <personname>s after a mere fortnight of their company
i daresay <personname> has told you i would be coming for him
said uncle <personname> loudly from the sofa
<personname> and <personname> both turned to look at him
the situation is fraught with complications
it might be that <personname> will arrive on the doorstep at any moment
he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle <personname> shouted  will you get these ruddy things off us
<personname> looked around all three of the <personname>s were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere
it seems that <personname> knew what he was doing
just one last thing then
no he does not
you did not do as i asked
both aunt <personname> and uncle <personname> looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than <personname> squeezed between them
began uncle <personname> furiously but <personname> raised his finger for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle <personname> dumb
you are with me said <personname> simply
you have not of course passed your apparition test he said
well here we go
all the windows were dark
the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too
a terrible loss
what exactly are they
<personname> suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls
he pushed past <personname> his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation
cannot move like i used to
and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said <personname>
you cannot have had more than three minutes warning
yes it usually goes in families
and ambrosius flume of honeydukes a hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkiss who gave him his first job and at the back you will see her if you just crane your neck that is gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies
i cannot pretend that amelia boness death did not shake me
he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a muggle-born should make a good witch
in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it
if you do not mind <personname> said <personname> as they passed through the gate i would like a few words with you before we part
you need your friends <personname>
well that means i will not see much of professor <personname> from now on he said because he will not let me carry on potions unless i get outstanding in my owl which i know i have not
even within hogwarts itself
they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety
please do not leave on my account said <personname> courteously i cannot stay i have urgent matters to discuss with rufus scrimgeour
sit down dear i will knock something up
it bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once
his mouth now full of bread <personname> shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head
of course he can be charming when he wants to be but <personname>s never liked him much
it is been a tough night
mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies
the boys would not do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection so is that why you are late metamorph-medals
<personname> and georges bedroom was on the second floor
he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and orange sweet which he recognized as a puking pastille
something wrong <personname>
i know someone who is worse than <personname> said a voice from the doorway
<personname> turned back to <personname> swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mrs <personname> across the face
stop calling her that <personname> said mrs <personname> sharply as <personname> and <personname> laughed
your mum said the shops going well said <personname>
blimey  private lessons with <personname> said <personname> looking impressed
<personname> shouted <personname> and <personname> the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash
and the defense against the dark arts practical was no good at all
yep nine outstandings and one exceeds expectations at defense against the dark arts
you can use our special bathroom now and everything wow i remember when <personname> wore one of these said <personname> examining the badge with glee
i got it out of your vault for you <personname> because it is taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much
the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them
migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us said <personname> stopping outside madam malkins and bending down to peer through the window
he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed <personname> <personname> and <personname> reflected over his shoulder
right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to <personname> and georges stick close now
we are testing most of our products on ourselves
<personname> left <personname> dabbing her black eye with paste and followed <personname> toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks
certainly they work for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question  and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side
guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher said <personname>
but you are moving through boyfriends a bit fast are not you
given her the slip by the looks of it said <personname>
<personname> would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly <personname> must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches
nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in <personname> and georges products
ouch shh look he is in there she breathed in <personname>s ear
judging by the movements of <personname>s hands he was talking animatedly
he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet
naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again
<personname> had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what <personname> was up to
when neither <personname> nor <personname> answered he said <personname>s fathers in azkaban
the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed <personname>s cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and <personname> <personname>s owl pigwidgeon and <personname>s new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages
instead two grim-faced bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking
<personname> had better go first with  she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized <personname>s upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten
said <personname> making up his mind on the spur of the moment
of course said mr <personname> who looked slightly surprised but followed <personname> out of earshot of the others nevertheless
when we were in diagon alley <personname> began but mr <personname> forestalled him with a grimace
very well then let us hear the worst
i think he is been branded with the dark mark
oh
and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her
an empty seat where <personname> now sat and a scarless <personname> who would have been kissed good bye by his own mother not <personname>s
<personname> sat up straight interested
here take a napkin
now tell me  it was as <personname> had suspected
of course one does not know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all <personname> who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing
an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea
said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into <personname>s foot
the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene <personname> could read every word of <personname>s comic directly below him
what is <personname> got to interest slughorn
<personname> sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair
when the dark <personname> takes over is he going to care how many owls or newts anyones got
of course he is not
<personname> was not afraid of <personname> but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins
he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again
<personname> was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position
they set off toward the lane that led to the school
how did you find me
i could climb a wall he suggested
<personname> wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed
<personname> was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on <personname>s other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before
him and everyone else here sniffed <personname>
now  to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you  his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer <personname> whispered to <personname>
seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted <personname> said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing
i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety
<personname> shook his head again
i am sorry <personname> but an acceptable really is not good enough to continue to n
and so you did when professor <personname> was teaching the subject
yes said <personname> but i did not buy the books or any ingredients or anything  i am sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor <personname>
the dark arts said <personname> are many varied ever changing and eternal
he loves them all that unfixed indestructible stuff  well said <personname> i thought he sounded a bit like you
i enjoy acid pops
he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table
featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too  who can
oho one of my best friends is muggle-born and she is the best in our yeah i am assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke <personname>
oh <personname> well what is so impressive about that
why do not people drink it all the time sir
too much of a good thing you know  highly toxic in large quantities
<personname> crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger
according to the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water
demanded <personname> who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple
he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon
excellent excellent <personname> good lord it is clear you have inherited your mothers talent
she was a dab hand at potions <personname> was here you are then here you are one bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well <personname> slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on <personname>s
he finished aggravated by her expression
could have been a catastrophe could not it
it seems all right said <personname> still staring at the book suspiciously
she merely scowled and twitched her essay on the principles of re materialization away from <personname> who was trying to read it upside down
<personname> had indeed been eyeing the pensieve with some apprehension
<personname> could see a village undoubtedly little hangleton nestled between two steep hills its church and graveyard clearly visible
he thought little hangleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance
ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once
do you know who you are talking to you filthy little mudblood do you
gaunt said defiantly to ogden
i expect you have wiped the muggle s filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot  that is hardly the point is it mr gaunt
everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called gaunt and his children
said <personname> at once as <personname> lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand
ogden apparated back to the ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes
marvolo
very good indeed said <personname> beaming
yes that was <personname> senior the handsome muggle who used to go riding past the gaunt cottage and for whom merope gaunt cherished a secret burning passion
and they ended up married
in any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal
you can imagine the gossip it caused when the squires son ran off with the tramps daughter merope
the shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself
you see within a few months of their runaway marriage <personname> reappeared at the manor house in little hangleton without his wife
the sky outside was inky black and the lamps in <personname> s office seemed to glow more brightly than before
he turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again
sitting on one of the little spindle legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone
good night
how are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject
you did not hear him going on about his gormless brother we would have been teaching <personname> how to tie his shoelaces if we would stayed
i am tall said <personname> inconsequentially
i mean  it is all looking serious is not it
well  if you wait over there  he pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where <personname> was sitting
you have had your go
do not worry about it said <personname> grimly
very amusin
all righ come in then you ungrateful little  mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass
if you ask me said <personname> quietly mclaggen looks like he was confunded this morning
after dinner they made their way back to gryffindor tower
hang on i will let you down  he groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell praying that this was the counter-jinx <personname> thought liberacorpus with all his might
it was a laugh said <personname> upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages
<personname> and george said <personname> shrugging it is their kind of thing
<personname> came to his aid
that was different he said robustly
thanks <personname>  it is <personname>s next lesson <personname> told <personname> and <personname> pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents
well i have had quidditch practice professor said <personname> who had indeed been scheduling practices every time slughorn had sent him a little violet ribbon-adorned invitation
unlucky again cried slughorn dramatically
hang on <personname> said slowly
i no  give it to me <personname> you must not shrieked <personname> as mundungus started to turn blue
the moment he was inside <personname> burst out he was nicking <personname>s stuff
<personname> was still fuming when <personname> returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer
jus bin visitin <personname> he is cornin on so well you wouldn  <personname> someone is hurt back there or cursed or something  wha
<personname> patted her shoulder gently
she did not say who would given it to her leanne
come on
no professor he told borgin to keep it in the shop for him  but <personname> <personname> interrupted borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and <personname> said no because he did not want to touch it obviously said <personname> angrily
the same is probably true of hundreds of people   that is what i said  muttered <personname>
so thank you for telling me your suspicions <personname> she said as she marched past them but i need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on katie bell
it could have been meant for loads of people said <personname>
<personname> the death eaters would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top targets
you will
she could have got food and everything for herself by magic could not she
she would not even stay alive for her son
oh said the bewildered-looking girl taking in <personname> s eccentric appearance
there have been incidents
a boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book
the boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands
did she get you in to have a look at me
i do not believe you said <personname>
i never did anything to little amy benson or dennis bishop and you can ask them they will tell you i am not from the asylum said <personname> patiently
he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer
prove it said <personname> at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said tell the truth
i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe
open the door said <personname>
i shall know whether it has been done
there is a fund at hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes
i have your list of books and school equipment with me
how do you get to this diagon alley sir
so when i have got all my stuff when do i come to this hogwarts
i shall see you at hogwarts
i can make them hurt if i want to
yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the dark arts although as we know there are parselmouths among the great and the good too
he she would his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of <personname> behind which he has been hidden for so long
so how was slughorns latest party
unnoticed by either he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation
the crash however appeared to have awoken <personname> and <personname> to <personname>s presence
are you still interested in playing chaser
right said <personname> tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at <personname> let us get this straight once and for all
he does not mean anything <personname>  said <personname> automatically though the monster was roaring its approval of <personname>s words
cmon said <personname> as the sound of <personname> s shuffling feet reached their ears
they had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing quidditch teasing <personname> and having a laugh about <personname> and phlegm
yeah maybe i am they glared at each other for a moment then <personname> shook his head wearily
do not drink that <personname> both <personname> and <personname> looked up at her
why not
he then looked around at <personname> who was smacking his lips
<personname> not playing
what
of course coote is not really the usual build for a beater said zacharias loftily they have generally got a bit more muscle  hit a bludger at him <personname> called to coote as he zoomed past but coote grinning broadly chose to aim the next bludger at harper instead who was just passing <personname> in the opposite direction
the atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant
you should not have done it
you spiked <personname>s juice with lucky potion at breakfast felix felicis no i did not said <personname> turning back to face them both
said <personname> dispassionately
good game <personname>
she patted him on the arm <personname> felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer
<personname>
oppugno came a shriek from the doorway
<personname> and george send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions said <personname>
demanded <personname>
i do not like it much
thank you <personname>
and she hurried off without giving <personname> any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any
<personname> was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her
so i will meet you in the entrance hall at eight of the clock then
squeezing herself in between <personname> and <personname> <personname> flung her arms around <personname>s neck
hi said <personname>
no said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip
obviously they did not want the truth to get out <personname> who thought it most unlikely that rufus scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to <personname> repeating her fathers bizarre views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching slughorns office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took
serves you right for coming with him he told her severely
said <personname> revolted
defense against the dark arts charms transfiguration herbology  all the subjects required in short for an auror said <personname> with the faintest sneer
all right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the rotfang conspiracy with professor trelawney who seemed sincerely interested
what was more difficult was finding <personname> and <personname>
if your friends <personname> and <personname> intend to pass their defense against the dark arts owl this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres  what does it matter
snow was drifting past the window in front of them
they are using knives and everything
no problem said george
they will say <personname> is not really trying to help <personname> he was just trying to find out what <personname>s up to
he was not entirely sure that she had heard him though <personname> and <personname> had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time
meanwhile <personname> who was thinner and more ragged looking than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear celestinas voice
i know <personname>s tried appealing directly to scrimgeour about stan
he kept me healthy
oh i have been underground said <personname>
many people were under the impression that i owned a badly behaved rabbit
i should have thought being the <personname>sen one would be enough
one of them was levicorpus  oh that one had a great vogue during my time at hogwarts said <personname> reminiscently
<personname> demanded of thin air looking rather shocked
a moment later <personname> had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggots
i did not know that could happen
rufus scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene
we have only looked in for five minutes so i will have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with <personname>
they think you quite the hero which of course you are <personname> chosen or not how many times have you faced <personname> now
i would not expect you to understand he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as <personname> had been
these are dangerous times and certain measures need to be taken
you are doing what <personname> <personname> did
there shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which <personname> <personname> had forced him to carve into his own flesh  must not tell lies
i do not remember you rushing to my defense when i was trying to tell everyone <personname> was back
said scrimgeour brusquely
i would leave <personname> alone if i were you
glad we straightened that out
when <personname> had arrived all three of them trooped out of <personname>s office and off toward gryffindor tower
several onlookers sniggered <personname> gave a tinkling laugh and said there is a table over here
nothing special
she looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so <personname> dropped the subject of <personname> and recounted all that he had overheard between <personname> and <personname>
yes i have said <personname> sounding startled
yeah but <personname>s bigger than me <personname> held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla so <personname> and george did not go on about it much  not to his face anyway  when can we take the actual test
yes said <personname>
yes that was why we argued
i do not think that it is of great importance
professor did you understand
here again was <personname> s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it but then <personname> remembered something
and now <personname> if you will stand  <personname> rose and <personname> saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling pearly memory
stop
<personname> frowned
he lived out the remainder of his life in azkaban lamenting the loss of marvolos last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls
<personname> however stayed behind
certainly said <personname>
he must be determined to hide what really happened if <personname> could not get it out of him she said in a low voice as they stood in the deserted snowy courtyard at break
you have not
<personname> cannot you
you have to understand the principles involved this time
there was golpalotts third law stated word for word as <personname> had recited it but not a single illuminating note in the princes hand to explain what it meant
<personname> was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron
well i cannot fault you
that is the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs said slughorn happily before <personname> could reply
infuriated by his failure and by <personname>s and <personname>s attitudes <personname> brooded for the next few days over what to do next about slughorn
now then  he waved his wand
adjust your hoops please and back to your original positions
deliberation
i did not feel anything said <personname> ignoring this interruption
said <personname>
<personname> did not answer he was too busy unwrapping presents every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure
there had to be an explanation for <personname>s periodic disappearances but he simply could not think what it could be
you have just eaten half a box of <personname>colate cauldrons have not you
i would take him to madam pomfrey but we are not supposed to have anything from <personname>s wizard wheezes and you know  awkward questions  i would have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy <personname> an expert potioneer like you
for a moment <personname> beamed at them
do not mention it mboy do not mention it said slughorn as <personname> collapsed into a nearby armchair looking devastated
professor <personname> bellowed
<personname> retold the story he had already recounted it felt like a hundred times to <personname> to <personname> to madam pomfrey to <personname> and to <personname>
they reckon he will be all right
she had been exceptionally quiet all day
not bad said <personname>
pretty firm with him
well there is nothing strange abou that <personname> added hastily as <personname> and <personname> exchanged looks full of meaning
he had been quite convinced that the common room was empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair
listen <personname> we should have a talk beforehand
still checking the marauders map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever <personname> happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary
said <personname> surprised for he had found <personname> perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of <personname> and <personname>s row and keen to abuse mclaggen as much as possible
<personname> spun around in midair
after a while madam pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown
quietly tentatively <personname> spoke into the darkness
it is all right said <personname> kindly hurrying forward to help her
the girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight <personname> glanced back at her
or are they still together
<personname> smiled vaguely
no i am serious said <personname> earnestly
no said <personname> divination is turning out to be much more trouble than i could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself
when he could stand it no longer he said professor <personname> i am really sorry
<personname> indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the pensieve
the idea that <personname> valued his opinion this highly made <personname> feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as <personname> raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it
this first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of hokey
at borgin and burkes
it was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwarts for nearly fifty years
he picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over hepzibah s fat little hand brushing it with his lips
mr burke wishes me to inquire oh mr burke phooey said hepzibah waving a little hand
pretty is not it
in both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death  hokey confessed
<personname> had entered the room
may i offer you a drink
that would be welcome said <personname>
well said <personname> still smiling to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills helping hone young minds
well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at hogwarts
i am yours to command
and what will become of those whom you command
he had just found an incantation  sectumsempral scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words for enemies and was itching to try it out but thought it best not to in front of <personname>
there said <personname> some twenty minutes later handing back <personname>s essay
the only sounds were the crackling of the fire and <personname> scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using <personname>s quill
<personname> has not slept for a week <personname> said <personname> proudly swaying where he stood
he has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students who keep watch for him while he enters  the room of requirement said <personname> smacking himself hard on the forehead with advanced potion making
<personname> and <personname> stared at him
said <personname> eagerly
but what is all this about him going up there with a variety of students
they are stupid enough to do what they are told even if he will not tell them what he is up to  but he does not want them to be seen lurking around outside the room of requirement so he is got them taking polyjuice to make them look like other people
yes we will <personname> said getting to her feet and stretching
a workshop
i need to see the place where <personname> keeps coming secretly
i need you to become the place you become for <personname>
er well ghosts are transparent  he said
a ghost as i trust that you are all aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth  and of course as <personname> so wisely tells us transparent
when you say you had lots in common said <personname> sounding rather amused now dyou mean he lives in an s-bend too
a young boy
he does not want to talk to me <personname> he can tell i have been trying to get him on his own again and he is not going to let it happen well you have just got to keep at it have not you
<personname> gave a high-pitched scream of terror threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor
i wondered whether it had not become  you know  him
dear <personname> <personname> and <personname> <personname> died last night <personname> and <personname> you met him and you know how special he was
i do not know  i was sort of saving it
demanded <personname> incredulously
oh stop that <personname> begged her i feel sick enough as it is quick hide me it is not <personname> said <personname> impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and <personname> dived behind her
repeated <personname> shocked
whispered <personname>
no said <personname> and <personname> together both looking positively alarmed now
you have not got another little bottle full of i do not know essence of insanity
suggested <personname> as <personname> swung his cloak over his shoulders
it is true then
you came croaked <personname> when he opened the door and saw <personname> emerging from the invisibility cloak in front of him
jus thought we would say a few nice things over him happy memories you know  his voice quivered and broke
she gave me her life but you will not give me a memory
you are the <personname>sen one
said <personname> his heart leaping
enter said <personname> when <personname> knocked
<personname> smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks
but <personname> could tell that slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork
well said slughorn not looking at <personname> but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple well it cannot hurt to give you an overview of course
of course he muttered this is all hypothetical what we are discussing is not it
<personname> sat too and waited for <personname> to speak
you heard <personname> what he particularly wanted from horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times rip his soul repeatedly so as to store it in many separately concealed horcruxes
well we know that he tried to do just that five years ago said <personname>
well as you now know for many years i have made it my business to discover as much as i can about <personname>s past life
even if he got something of ravenclaws or of gryffindors that leaves a sixth horcrux said <personname> counting on his fingers
you would certainly have been that
said <personname> thoroughly taken aback
<personname> felt his heart lift
so when the prophecy says that i will have power the dark <personname> knows not it just means love
pointing at <personname> with his black withered hand he said you are setting too much store by the prophecy but spluttered <personname> but you said the prophecy means  if <personname> had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled
a flame seemed to leap inside his chest searing his throat
listen i would better go i would not put it past <personname> to give me lines even if it is my first day back
sometimes he thought that the post-<personname> <personname> might not mind too much if he asked <personname> out but then he remembered <personname>s expression when he had seen her kissing dean and was sure that <personname> would consider it base treachery if <personname> so much as held her hand
and then he was staring at <personname> again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom
bring them to me here
your potions book
<personname> hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure
yes said <personname> with a touch more defiance
they are the records of other hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments
<personname> was beaming but <personname>s eyes sought <personname>
thanks said <personname> grinning
just because i have given my permission does not mean i cannot withdraw it   your permission  scoffed <personname>
oh not again he groaned
oh come on
this girl has not got anything to do with it
the library said <personname> predictably
he was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with <personname>
he found this very odd the room had opened for him after all when he had wanted to hide the half-blood princes book
the inner eye said professor trelawney with dignity straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices
i think you would better tell professor <personname> said <personname>
<personname> and <personname> together had sent <personname> hunting after <personname> and <personname> and their son
i am fine said <personname> shortly racing past them
<personname> will not be here tonight so <personname>s going to have another clear shot at whatever he is up to
i have not got time to argue said <personname> curtly
he felt it best to be honest what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go
lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the three broomsticks they heard raucous shouting
he was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and churning below him
then take off your invisibility cloak there is no need for it now and let us take the plunge
twice <personname> walked right around the cave touching as much of the rough rock as he could occasionally pausing running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot until finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall
he did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently as though something extremely interesting was written on it
i rather think said <personname> putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind <personname> used to chop potion ingredients that we are required to make payment to pass
after me i think said <personname> and he walked through the archway with <personname> on his heels lighting his own wand hastily as he went
but we do not know what the thing was said <personname> looking at the sinisterly smooth water
<personname> did not say anything
but why have they let us
there was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boats prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center
i think i saw a hand in the water a human hand yes i am sure you did said <personname> calmly
i am sure that once we take the horcrux we shall find them less peaceable
said <personname>
do not forget that <personname> believes that he alone knows about his horcruxes
<personname> made to speak again but this time <personname> raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard
<personname> wondered whether he was in pain
his face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream
here  hating himself repulsed by what he was doing <personname> forced the goblet back toward <personname> s mouth and tipped it so that <personname> drank the remainder of the potion inside
yes  he leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it
and now <personname> s breathing was fading
his brain whirling in panic <personname> knew instinctively the only way left to get water because <personname> had planned it so  he flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish
lean on me sir
i need <personname>
i saw you apparate as i was pulling my bedroom curtains thank goodness thank goodness i could not think what to but what is wrong with <personname>
no <personname> can do it
do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak
<personname> saw <personname>s pale eyes shift back to <personname> in the greenish glare of the mark
<personname> looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit
<personname>s sigh was half a groan
i have not got any options said <personname> and he was suddenly white as <personname>
no draco said <personname> quietly
that is right rasped the other
he was not looking at fenrir he did not seem to want to even glance at him
i said no shouted the brutal-faced man there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way he hit the ramparts and staggered looking furious
<personname>  please  <personname> raised his wand and pointed it directly at <personname>
he skidded around the corner his trainers slippery with blood <personname> had an immense head start
was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the room of requirement or had the order made steps to secure it to prevent the death eaters retreating that way
someone was screaming he would surely die of this agony <personname> was going to torture him to death or madness no roared <personname>s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started <personname> lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead <personname> was shouting have you forgotten our orders
you dare use my own spells against me <personname>
spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars
he could see blood trickling down <personname>s cheek from a deep cut under one eye which was swelling rapidly
he imagined that he could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort
under where the mark  blimey  you don think someone got thrown
it had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground
and although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already <personname> knew as he picked it up that there was something wrong
i face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more
it is <personname>s orders said <personname>
<personname> what happened
this is all my fault said professor <personname> suddenly
we knew nobody could fly in
there were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle
as professor <personname> nodded <personname> felt <personname> move beside him and looked at her
no that is not what i  because e will said <personname> drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair
i have said all along you are taking a ridiculous line on this <personname> said mrs <personname> over <personname>s shoulder as she patted her on the back
<personname> is dead
as <personname> nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at <personname>
in silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office
personally i do not think we are in more danger at hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you cannot expect mothers to think like that
we must consult the governors said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in <personname>s office
they will want to say  the last word caught in his throat but professor sprout completed the sentence for him
seconded barked professor sprout
said <personname> at once
no she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper
helped him  it was an almost unendurable thought now
he knew when i used sectumsempra
he had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when <personname> had died
though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that <personname> had really gone
<personname> had not spared <personname> much thought
it is nearly time she said
most <personname> did not recognize but a few he did including members of the order of the phoenix kingsley shacklebolt <personname> <personname> <personname> her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink <personname> with whom she seemed to be holding hands mr and mrs <personname> <personname> supported by <personname> and followed by <personname> and george who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin
he was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his arms wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars was what <personname> knew to be <personname>s body
and <personname> saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally <personname> all determined to protect him but now that was over
the little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat
<personname> uses people his enemies are close to
with a miserable gesture <personname> got up turned his back on <personname> and on <personname>s tomb and walked away around the lake
<personname> he turned
i have been hoping to have a word  do you mind if i walk a little way with you
such loyalty is admirable of course said scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty but <personname> is gone <personname>
